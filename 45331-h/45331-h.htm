<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Why</span> do we pursue one method when instructing
an individual boy out of school, and a very
different method when teaching a class of boys in
school?</p>

<p>The school method of teaching the dynamo is
to begin with the bar magnet and, through a series
of thirty or forty lessons on fundamental principles,
lead up to the dynamo, which is then presented, with
considerable attention to detail, as a composite
application of principles. This might be styled
the synthetic method. He who teaches a boy out
of school is pretty likely to reverse this order and
pursue the analytic method. The class in school
has very little influence in determining the order
of procedure. The lone pupil with his questions
almost wholly determines the order of procedure.
Out of school no one has the courage to deny information
to a hungry boy; in school we profess
to put a ban upon information giving, and we do
quite effectually deaden his sense of hunger. The
school method rarely yields fruit which lasts beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
the examination period; on the other hand, a
considerable number of boys have become electrical
experts without the aid of a school. This
book is the story of how my boy and I studied
<i>electricity</i> together. We have had no other
method than to attack our problems directly,
and <i>principles</i> have come in only when they were
needed.</p>

<p>My boy had learned to read when very young
by having stories read to him while he watched
the printed pages. The construction of sentences
out of words and words out of letters had come to
him very incidentally but all in due time, and when
he first went to school rather late in life for a beginner
he found himself more proficient than the
other boys of his own age both in reading and in
understanding the printed pages. I could see no
good reason why he should not pursue the same
method in studying electricity.</p>

<p>We live in a modern apartment house in a great
city. My boy likes to visit engine rooms and talk
with the engineers about their machinery. His
mother and I always encourage him to talk with us
about the things in which he is most interested.
If the family is alone at dinner, he is quite likely
to lead the conversation into the field of electricity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
When particularly burdened with my work I have
learned to find relief by giving an afternoon to
Harold, who generally takes me to some electrical
store or power station or to ride by electric train
out into the country.</p>

<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I<br /><br />
<small>THE DYNAMO AND THE POWER STATION</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">One</span> day Harold expressed a desire to see
the dynamos, five miles away, which furnish
the electric light in our apartment.
So I told him to invite his best friend to accompany
us and we would go.</p>

<p>When we were some distance from the station
the boys noticed the very tall chimneys and inquired
why tall chimneys were needed for dynamos.
I explained that the dynamos were run by steam-engines,
and steam-engines required the burning
of coal. "Oh!" said Ernest, Harold's friend,
"I read in the paper that electricity is the rival
of steam and is going to drive out the steam-engine."
I suggested that we were about to see some steam-engines
driving electricity out of that power station.
But more seriously, I explained that steam-engines
were used for many years as locomotives to draw
the trains on the elevated railroads of New York
City, and when at last they were displaced by
electric trains some people thought that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
a case of electricity driving out steam, whereas
what had really happened was that the steam
power for running those trains had been concentrated
at a central station, and its power was
merely transmitted to the trains by means of
electricity. The trains were, therefore, run by
steam power quite as much as ever. In like
manner, the surface cars of New York a few years
ago were run by a cable, which was merely a very
long belt used to transmit to the cars the power
of steam-engines located at a central station.
When they were changed to electric cars, electricity
became the successful rival of nothing
else than a twisted wire cable. The cars still
run by steam power as before, but that power
is transmitted by electricity instead of the discarded
cable. Steam has driven out the horse
as a power for drawing street cars, and electricity
has enabled us to gather all the steam engines
into central stations, where now they are furnishing
the power for moving surface, elevated, and
subway cars for street traffic, as also trains for
suburban travel. Central station steam-engines
are producing a vast amount of power, distributed
all over the city by means of electricity, for doing
a great variety of work and for furnishing electric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
light and heat, all of which we shall presently
study. "Just before we go into this central station,
can you tell me how the elevator is run in
our apartment house?" "It is an electric elevator,"
said Harold. "And where does the electricity
come from?" I inquired. "Well, I know that
it comes from the street mains, but do they come
from this power station?" "Yes," said I, "and
we will now go in and see the steam-engines which
lift you up stairs many times each day by sending
electricity to run that elevator. If you choose
to do so, you may claim for purposes of discussion
that your elevator is run by steam."</p>

<p>As we entered the building we came first to
the dynamo room and both boys noticed that
the tone which met their ears was that which
I had produced for them in the telephone the
night before. "I shall try to show you before
we get through," I said, "that these dynamos
are doing something which makes iron pulsate
sixty times a second and that that is the cause
of the pitch of this tone. But let us begin with
the coal which is the source of all this power.</p>

<p>"This particular station at the present time is
burning forty tons of coal an hour. That is as
much as Mr. &mdash;&mdash; uses to heat his twelve-room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
house for a whole year. One pound of coal is
capable of liberating enough energy to supply
5&frac34; horse-power for an hour. (Written for short
5&frac34; H.P.H.) One ton of coal is capable of furnishing
(2,000 × 5&frac34;) 11,500 H.P.H. Forty tons
would yield 460,000 H.P.H. But the best furnaces,
boilers, and steam-engines are terribly wasteful
of energy. About nine tenths of all this energy
is wasted and only one tenth, or about 46,000
horse-power per hour, is delivered by the steam-engines
to the dynamos.</p>

<p>"Coal is already scarce in the world and the
supply is rapidly being exhausted. Meanwhile
we are growing more dependent upon coal. A
century ago we used scarcely any power except
that of men, horses, and oxen, and what little
heat men then used came chiefly from wood.
They lived in cold houses, attended cold churches
and schools, did not ride in steam or electric cars,
and did not have power plants. Our wood is
nearly all gone, our coal is going, and we are very
rapidly growing more dependent upon heat and
power, our chief source of which is coal. Wind
power is too uncertain to depend upon, and we
turned our backs upon water-power when
we began to crowd into cities. What little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
water-power there is, however, is nearly all in
use.</p>

<p>"There is great need both that we learn how
to save the major part of the energy of the coal
which we now waste, and that we find a substitute
for the coal to use when that is gone.</p>

<p>"A part of the heat from the forty tons of coal
which is being burned in this particular power
plant goes into the water in the boilers. It converts
this water into steam. The steam, if free
to expand into the air, would occupy about one
thousand seven hundred times the volume of the
water. We compel it to expand through the
cylinders of the steam-engine, using its force of
expansion to make wheels go around&mdash;to make the
dynamo revolve. These dynamos are not <i>devices
for producing power but merely for transmitting</i> the
power of these steam-engines to far away places
where it may be used, as, for instance, in our
apartment house, where we are unwilling to walk
upstairs and want some power to carry us.</p>

<p>"Our own apartment is fifty feet above the street.
I weigh one hundred and sixty-five pounds. If I
walk up stairs from the street to our apartment in one
minute, which is the rate of a rather slow elevator,
I work at the rate of one quarter of a horse-power.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
One hundred and sixty-five pounds raised two hundred
feet in one minute requires one horse-power.
You boys each weigh about half as much as I do, and
if one of you walks up the same stairs in one minute
you exert half the power that I do, or if you run
up the stairs in half a minute you exert the same
power, that is, one quarter of a horse-power.
When we three walk up together in one minute we
exert one half horse-power. If we all three run
up the stairs in half a minute we expend one
horse-power. Now, the speed of elevators for
apartment houses is about one hundred feet a
minute. We are unwilling to walk up stairs, not
because we are lazy but because we have the New
York haste, and so we employ elevators which
run at the rate of about one hundred feet a
minute.</p>

<p>"These dynamos enable us to employ the power
of this central station to run the elevator in our
apartment house. Here is a dynamo rolling over
now in the act of sending out power, some of
which goes to that elevator; and standing beside it
is another waiting to be used when necessary.
Examining these dynamos, we find that they are
composed of nothing else than iron and copper.
About all that we can say of these mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
machines is that the moving iron generates the
electricity and the copper leads it away.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">

<a id="Fig1"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 1</div>
</div>

<p>"Each one of these dynamos has many hundred
tons of iron in it. A
huge wheel of iron,
thirty-two feet in diameter,
one hundred
feet in circumference,
portions of which are
surrounded by insulated
copper conductors,
forms the centre-piece
of the machine. This
movable part weighs
four hundred tons. Around about this is a fixed ring
of iron, portions of which are surrounded by
insulated copper conductors. Ordinarily the ring
which is stationary is called 'the field,' and
the wheel, which rotates, is called 'the armature,'
although these terms are sometimes reversed
for certain reasons. The movable part in
these machines rotates about once a second, that
is, its circumference moves a little faster than
a mile a minute. The iron moving at this high
rate of speed creates ether streams or electric
currents, which are led off by the copper conductors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
The generation of electricity on a large scale
requires large masses of iron and high velocity."</p>

<p>I noticed that the boys stood before this machine
in a state of utter bewilderment, bewildered as a
man who is told that what he had considered north
is really south, bewildered as a man who, having
wandered through a maze of city streets, looks
up at length and unexpectedly finds the building
he has been seeking towering before him.
The questions they asked were entirely without
thought. "What is inside of it?" "Simply more
iron and copper, such as you see on the surface,"
I replied. "But what makes it go?" "The steam engines,
of course, four of which you see, are
coupled directly to each dynamo." "But where
does it get its electricity?" "Don't forget that you
are looking at <i>a generator</i> of electricity. Big mass
of iron&mdash;rapid motion! That is the whole truth.
But it cannot satisfy you as an answer until you
have become used to it. We have seen all that
we ought to see here to-day. Let us drop the whole
matter now, but return to my laboratory to-morrow,
and I will give you the next step which will help you."</p>

<p>The boys did no talking upon their return journey.
Whether one may say they were thinking or not I
cannot tell, but certainly their ideas were incubating.</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II<br /><br />
<small>THE DYNAMO, CONTINUED&mdash;THE MAGNET</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">When</span> we had gathered at my laboratory
the next day I took down a spool of one
pound No. 24 cotton-covered copper wire
(<a href="#Fig2">Fig. 2</a> <i>A</i>), which had its centre filled with wire nails.
The boys had seen it before and remembered it.
With flexible wires I connected the two ends of the
wire on this spool to a sensitive ammeter, <i>B</i>, which
had its zero in the middle of the scale, and I laid
down upon the table a bar magnet, <i>C</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_028.jpg" width="500" height="575" alt="" />
<a id="Fig2"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 2</div>
</div>

<p>"Here," I said, "is a dynamo complete." The
bar magnet furnishes the 'field' and this spool of
copper wire, <i>A</i>, which I will move back and forth
immediately over the magnet from end to end, is
'the armature.' <i>D</i> and <i>e</i> are the line wires and the
circuit is completed through the ammeter to show
whether we are generating electricity. And now
as I move this armature along the field you see the
needle of the ammeter move to the right from
zero to ten. When the armature is moved in the
opposite direction along the field the needle moves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
in the opposite direction past zero and on to ten at
the left. The moving of the needle in the ammeter
shows that we are generating electricity. The
swinging to and fro of
the needle shows that
we are generating an
alternating current of
electricity. It is a
mere matter of detail
whether we move the
armature or the field,
as I will show you by
letting the spool A rest
quietly upon the table
and moving the magnet
to and fro lengthwise across the end of the
spool. Or I may accomplish the same results
by moving them both in opposite directions. It
is simply necessary that they move <i>with reference</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
<i>to each other</i>. Some dynamos are made with stationary
fields and rotating armatures, some with
stationary armature and rotating fields, and some
with both parts designed to rotate in opposite
directions.</p>

<p>"Magnetism is not confined to the magnet.
It extends more or less widely into the region about
it. It is this region affected by the magnet that we
designate its magnetic field. By bringing this
sensitive compass needle into the region of this
bar magnet from all directions, I show you that it
has a slight power to change the direction of the
needle when about a foot away. This power
grows rapidly greater as the distance grows less.
Of course its field extends rather indefinitely, but
we may say that this particular magnet has an
appreciable field extending about one foot in all
directions from it. We find upon examination
that some magnets have bigger and stronger fields
than others, that all have their strongest fields when
first magnetized and lose their strength gradually,
<i>but never entirely</i>. We find that hardened iron and
steel hold magnetism longer than soft iron, <i>but all
iron is magnetized somewhat at all times</i>. Iron that
is feebly magnetized can be made into a strong
magnet by bringing it into a strong magnetic field.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
The earth is a feeble magnet, and that is why it
gives direction to the compass needle. That is
also probably the reason why every piece of iron
upon the earth is a magnet, or, to put the cause
back another step, we may say that whatever causes
the earth to be a magnet also causes every piece of
iron upon the earth to be likewise a magnet.</p>

<p>"But thanks to Oersted in Denmark in 1819
and Faraday in England in 1821 and Joseph Henry
in Albany, N. Y., in 1827, we have learned to make
exceedingly powerful magnets by sending a current
of electricity in a whirl around the iron. This
is the meaning of the coils of copper wire around
iron cores in the dynamo, in electric bells, in telegraph
sounders, in motors, etc., etc. To prevent the
electric current from taking the shortest route,
through the iron core or through the successive
layers of copper wire, the iron core and the wire
must be covered with something like wood or paper
or cotton or silk or rubber&mdash;such things as electricity
does not readily pass through&mdash;that is,
insulating material.</p>

<p>"Joseph Henry, while teaching in the Albany
Academy, was the first to make electro-magnets.
There was no such thing as wire covered with an
insulating material then in the market, and he wound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
all his wire with silk ribbon. But in the year 1834
he made magnets which lifted thirty-five hundred
pounds, to the astonishment of every one. A pair
of such electro-magnets as I have here (<a href="#Fig3">Fig. 3</a>),
each consisting of one pound of No. 24 cotton covered
copper wire, eight hundred feet long, wound
in one thousand turns about an iron core two
inches in diameter, will lift several hundred pounds:
much more than we three can lift, as I shall now
show you."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_031.jpg" width="600" height="212" alt="" />
<a id="Fig3"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 3</div>
</div>

<p>The cores of the two magnets were bolted fast
to an iron beam, and a large bar of iron with a
ring in it was laid across the other free ends of the
magnet cores. I made connections with the electric
lighting circuit (that in my laboratory is what
is called a direct current), and sent a current of
electricity around the coils. The two boys and I
tugged at the ring in the iron bar to no avail. We
were unable to pull the iron bar away from the magnet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
But when I opened the switch and cut off
the electric current, one boy with one finger in the
ring lifted the bar with perfect ease.</p>

<p>"Electro-magnets are now made with a magnetic
intensity 90,700 times that of the earth's magnetism.
Electro-magnets are used for hoisting iron castings
weighing many tons. Here is a picture of an
electro-magnet lifting a whole wagon load of kegs
of nails from the wagon to the hold of a ship.</p>

<p>"Electro-magnets are our only means of utilizing
electricity for power. It is the pull of electro-magnets
that moves the electric car. Electro-magnets
are now used for pulling all the trains
out of the Grand Central Depot in New York
City.</p>

<p>"Let us now compare the strength of our electro-magnet
with that of the bar magnet used in our
former experiment."</p>

<p>I opened and closed the switch, which sent the
electric current through my magnet coils at frequent
intervals, and the two boys, each with a compass
needle, searched the field for magnetic effects. They
found that the magnetic field extended six or eight
feet, but this piece of research was broken up by a
new idea which appeared to strike them both at
the same instant, for they shouted both together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
"Let's use this electro-magnet in place of the bar
magnet for our dynamo experiment!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="PL2"></a><img src="images/i_033.jpg" width="400" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="capr">Photograph by Helen W. Cooke</div>
<div class="caption">Wiring</div>
</div>

<p>"That is surely the next step in our programme,"
said I, "but you will need a steam-engine to move an
armature in this magnetic field, will you not, judging
from the struggle we had with that iron bar a few
minutes ago?" The boys looked quite hopeless
until I said, "The best thing about the electro-magnet
remains yet to be told. You have perfect
control of its strength by changing the amount of
electricity which you send around the coil.</p>

<p>"By means of an instrument which works like
the motorman's controller on the electric car, I
may control the amount of electricity which flows,
just as well as you may control the flow of water
by a faucet or stop-cock. By this means I will
control the strength of the magnet so that you may
move the armature in your dynamo experiment.</p>

<p>"In 1821, Faraday, at the Royal Institution, London,
learned that he could produce magnetism by
means of the electric current, and, in 1831, he learned
that the reverse was also true, namely, that he could
produce electricity from magnetism. This idea
coming as the result of ten years of incessant search
made him shout and dance like a child. You are
feeling a little of the pleasure of his discovery."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_036.jpg" width="600" height="319" alt="" />
<a id="Fig4"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 4</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>I then fastened one of the coils upon the table
underneath a small bench (<a href="#Fig4">Fig. 4</a>) and sent an
electric current around it. The other coil, <i>B</i>,
connected with the ammeter was pushed back
and forth along the surface of the bench over this
coil. The boys found that the more electric current
I sent around the coil <i>A</i>, that is, the stronger I
made the magnetic field, the harder it was to move
the coil <i>B</i>. They found that the nearer <i>B</i> was to <i>A</i>
the harder it was to move it. They found that
the faster they moved <i>B</i> the more electricity was
produced. They tried laying <i>B</i> upon its side upon
the bench and thus moving it. They tried taking
<i>B</i> off the bench and moving it on all sides of <i>A</i>.
They found it much harder to move in some ways<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
than in others, but in all cases they found that the
harder they had to work the more electricity was
developed, as was shown by the ammeter.</p>

<p>"The dynamo is any machine which will convert
mechanical work into electricity. The magneto
is one form of a dynamo which you have used much
at the summer cottage, but have never seen the
inside of. Here are several (see Figs. <a href="#Fig5">5</a>, <a href="#Fig6">6</a>, and <a href="#Fig8">8</a>)
which I will let you examine inside and out, and
with these I must leave you to yourselves for a
time."</p>

<p>When I returned I asked the boys why these
dynamos were called <i>magnetos</i>. "Because they
have steel magnets for their fields," they replied.
"There are several magnets bent in the shape of a
horseshoe."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "in this case the field is made
stronger by taking several magnets. Have you
noticed any armature?" "Yes, it is made of iron
with insulated copper wire wound around it."</p>

<p>"Please recall that the amount of energy you
expend in going upstairs depends on two things:
(1) your weight and (2) the speed with which you
move. Also recall that the amount of electricity
you could generate with a dynamo depended upon
the amount of energy you expended. Therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the strength of the electric current which this machine
may produce depends upon two things: (1)
the strength of the magnetic field against which
you must pull and (2) the speed of the motion of
the armature. Evidently this field is made as
strong as it is possible to make it with steel magnets.
Now is there any device for giving high speed to
the armature?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," said the boys, "one has a pulley
so that it may be connected by a belt with a gas engine,
and the others have each a large cog-wheel
working into a smaller one. We found in one of
them that a single revolution of the crank gave six
revolutions to the armature."</p>

<p>I found that the boys had made large-sized
drawings of the parts,
and were preparing to
report on the magneto
as a form of dynamo
at the next meeting of
the Science Club, which
we had started among
the boys in school.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_038.jpg" width="300" height="236" alt="" />
<a id="Fig5"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 5</div>
</div>

<p>"I will loan you some apparatus so that you may
give a very interesting demonstration on that
subject," said I, "only let me show you how to use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
it first. Connect the binding posts <i>D</i> and <i>E</i> of this
magneto (<a href="#Fig5">Fig. 5</a>) with my ammeter. Turn the
crank <i>very</i> slowly and notice that the needle of the
ammeter swings to and fro with each revolution of
the armature. That shows that you have not
only a <i>dynamo</i>, but an <i>alternating current</i> dynamo.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_039.jpg" width="300" height="329" alt="" />
<a id="Fig6"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 6</div>
</div>

<p>"Now connect the binding posts <i>d</i> and <i>e</i>
of this magneto (<a href="#Fig6">Fig. 6</a>) with a short piece of copper
wire. Turn the crank
and you notice that this
dynamo rings two electric
bells. Turn slowly
and you notice that the
alternations of the current
are numbered by
the strokes on the bells.
The hammer swings to
and fro just as the needle
of the ammeter did.
Each bell therefore receives one stroke of the
hammer for each revolution of the armature.
Now try to turn the crank steadily at the rate
of one revolution per second. The armature
is making six revolutions, or cycles, per second
and you now have not only an alternating current
dynamo but a <i>six-cycle alternating current dynamo</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
The lighting circuit used in our apartment is a
<i>sixty</i>-cycle alternating current. To be sure the
armature of the dynamo which generates that
current revolves only once a second, but it carries
coils enough upon its rim to make that number
of alternations.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_040.jpg" width="300" height="256" alt="" />
<a id="Fig7"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 7</div>
</div>

<p>"Now connect this telephone receiver with the
binding posts <i>D</i> and <i>E</i> of this magneto (<a href="#Fig7">Fig. 7</a>).
Unscrew the cap of the
receiver. Move to one
side the iron diaphragm
and turn slowly the
crank of the magneto.
Notice that the diaphragm
vibrates in time
with the alternations of
the dynamo. Replace the diaphragm, screw on the
cap, hold the receiver to your ear and turn the crank
as fast as you can. You will probably be able to make
about sixteen cycles per second. The receiver in that
case is giving forth a sound of the same pitch as a
sixteen-foot closed organ-pipe.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_041.jpg" width="300" height="261" alt="" />
<a id="Fig8"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 8</div>
</div>

<p>"Connect the telephone receiver to the binding
posts <i>D</i> and <i>E</i> of this magneto (<a href="#Fig8">Fig. 8</a>), and by means
of a belt connect the pulley to this series of cog-wheels.
Now you may turn the crank and readily make the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
armature revolve at the rate of sixty cycles per
second, and you notice that you get the same
tone that we heard in the
dynamo room of the power
station and the same
tone the telephone receiver
gave when I connected
it to a coil in our
apartment. The tone
which is produced by
sixty vibrations per second
is very nearly that of the <i>C</i> two octaves
below middle <i>C</i> on the piano. Try it along with
the piano and you will find it a little flat. This
string on the piano is making sixty-four <i>vibrations
per second</i>.</p>

<img src="images/i_041a.jpg" width="300" height="251" alt="" />
<a id="Fig9"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 9</div>
</div>

<p>"Now connect this miniature
telephone switchboard
lamp with the
magneto (<a href="#Fig9">Fig. 9</a>) and
turn the crank fast.
The lamp lights up to
full brilliancy and you
notice that the light is steady, although it is
made by an alternating current passing through
the filament in one direction, stopping entirely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and then passing in the opposite direction.
The filament has no time to cool off, provided
you turn fast enough, but try turning a little
slower and you will notice the flickering of the
lamp."</p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III<br /><br />
<small>THE AMMETER</small></h2>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_043.jpg" width="600" height="375" alt="" />
<a id="Fig10"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 10</div>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">At the</span> last meeting of the Science Club
so many questions were asked, which the
demonstrators could not answer, that a
programme committee, to whom such questions
might be referred thereafter, was appointed. It
was made the duty of this committee to assign to
various members the task of searching for satisfactory
answers, and when the material was ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
to be reported to the club, the programme committee
determined the time and order of presentation.
I found that I had been made an honorary member
of this committee and that it was expected that I
should steer the committee. I told them that I
accepted this appointment with the understanding
that the fellow who steers is always the smallest
man in the crew, and if they would do all the work
I would enjoy the honorary title of cockswain.
Secretly, however, I appreciated that this was in
effect adding several courses to my already rather
heavy programme. I must, under the régime, direct
a large number of inexperienced students in library
research, in laboratory research, and in the art of
giving demonstrations with apparatus and experiments
to audiences.</p>

<p>The most urgent questions, as
also those which were next in
the natural order, concerned
the <i>ammeter</i>. I told the committee
to make that the subject
of the next meeting and to send
to my laboratory on a certain day
the person or persons whom they might appoint to
report upon it.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_044.jpg" width="200" height="229" alt="" />
<a id="Fig11"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 11</div>
</div>

<p>I find that the boys never come singly, but generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
in pairs. When the boys came they found
lying upon the table an ammeter (<a href="#Fig11">Fig. 11</a>).</p>

<p>I told one of them to take out the three screws
in the front and remove the face
of the instrument. I had told the
boys that the instrument cost sixty
dollars and that letting them open
it was like letting them open my
watch. As soon as the face came
off one of the boys exclaimed that
from my reference to the watch he
had expected to see very complicated
machinery with many wheels,
but from the exceeding simplicity of the mechanism
he could not see why it should cost sixty
dollars. I told him that although it was a fine
piece of workmanship it was fortunately very easy
to understand, and I asked them if it reminded
them of anything else that they had ever seen. After
a few moments of reflection they agreed that
it was very much like one of the magnetos. "Well,"
said I, "where is the field?"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_045.jpg" width="200" height="330" alt="" />
<a id="Fig12"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 12</div>
</div>

<p>"Is this horseshoe arrangement a magnet?"
they inquired.</p>

<p>"There is a compass needle right at your hand
waiting to answer that question," I replied. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
immediately found that it was a magnet. "Well,"
I said, "to be really sure that it is a magnet you
must find a portion of it that will <i>repel</i> a portion of
your compass needle as well as other portions in
both horseshoe and needles which attract each
other." Whereupon, they found that the portion
marked <i>N</i> (<a href="#Fig13">Fig. 13</a>) repelled the blue end of the
compass needle and attracted
strongly the bright end of the
needle, while the portion marked
<i>S</i> did the reverse. "We will call <i>N</i>
and <i>S</i> the poles of the magnet.
This is simply a steel bar magnet
bent into the shape of a horseshoe."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_046.jpg" width="200" height="311" alt="" />
<a id="Fig13"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 13</div>
</div>

<p>"You told us," remarked one of
the boys, "that steel magnets
gradually lose their strength. How then can this
be correct as a measuring instrument?"</p>

<p>"It is the purpose of the iron case to enable this
magnet to retain its magnetism, and if you will
examine its field, as we did that of another magnet
upon a former occasion, you will find that although
this is a strong steel magnet its field does not extend
outside of the iron case. It is as though we could
box up magnetism and keep it from escaping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now if this is like the magneto, where is the
armature? The spool-like thing between the poles
of the magnet looks just like the armature in one
of the magnetos.</p>

<p>"Yes, it has an iron core with a coil of insulated
wire around it, and you remember that when an
electric current is sent around a piece of iron, that
iron is made into a magnet, and if it is a magnet
it must have poles. It is very delicately poised upon
a pivot and will act exactly like your compass
needle, which is also a little magnet with poles.
I will send an electric current through the wire
which surrounds this armature, and you notice
that the needle which it carries moves to the right.
Notice that the lower end of this armature acts
like the blue end of your compass needle in that it
is repelled from the pole <i>N</i> of the field and is attracted
toward <i>S</i> of the field. In like manner, the upper
end or pole of the armature is repelled from <i>S</i> and
attracted to <i>N</i> of the field. The blue end of the
compass needle is called its north pole because it
points north under the magnetic influence of the
earth, and so we may call the lower end of the
armature its north pole.</p>

<p>"The electric current which I am sending through
the armature comes first through one ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
16-candle-power electric lamp which you see lighted
on this 'resistance board,' as it is called, and you
notice that the needle points to .5. This means
that half an ampere of electricity is passing through
this lamp. I will now send the current through a
32-candle-power lamp, and you notice that the
needle points to one, indicating that one ampere is
required to light that lamp. But what prevents
the needle from going farther, and what brings it
back to zero each time?" The boys discovered a
very small spring, like the hair spring of a watch,
coiled around the pivot of the armature. "So, then,
one ampere of electricity gives magnetism to this
armature so that it may pull against its coiled spring
hard enough to carry the needle to the point one.
Twice as much electricity will give it magnetism
enough to carry it to two, and so on across the scale.</p>

<p>"The full name of this instrument is Ampere
meter, which by usage has been shortened to ammeter.
It was named in honour of André Marie
Ampère, who was born at Lyons, in France, in 1775,
the year our Revolutionary War broke out. He died
in 1836. When Oersted made his famous discovery
of the action of an electric current upon a magnetic
needle, in 1819, Ampère was in middle life (forty-four),
and took up the same line of research with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
great vigour. The next year, 1820, he discovered
what you will doubtless enjoy rediscovering now.</p>

<p>"You will notice that the binding posts on the
bottom of this ammeter are marked, one positive, +,
and the other, negative -. The electric current now
enters the instrument by the post marked + and
after passing around the armature leaves by the
post marked -. I will reverse the connections
and thus send the current around the armature in
the other direction, and you notice that its poles
are now reversed. The lower end which was formerly
the north pole of the armature has now become
the south pole, as proven by the fact that it is repelled
from the south pole of the field and attracted
to its north pole. This carried the needle to the
left, and inasmuch as the zero is in the middle of
the scale we may with this instrument both measure
the amount of current and tell its direction. You
will recall that when we connected the magneto
with this instrument, it indicated that the magneto
sent the current first in one direction and then in
the other, which we call an 'alternating current.'
But you notice that the current which I am using
in this laboratory flows continuously in one direction.
This is called the 'direct current.' We shall
find out how a dynamo may produce a direct current<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
at another time. Let us not forget, however, that
we have repeated Ampère's discovery, and found
out that the direction in which we send the current
around an electro-magnet determines which end
shall be its north and which its south pole. If you
will note carefully which way the wire is wound
around the armature you will see that when I send
the current in at the positive post it is passing around
the north pole of the armature opposite to the direction
in which the hands of a clock move. If I reverse
the current it passes around the lower end of
the armature <i>in the same direction as the hands of
a clock move</i> and then this end becomes a south pole.
This is 'Ampère's rule,' and it is what candidates
for admission to college are very careful to learn.</p>

<p>"Before we replace the face of this ammeter I
must call your attention to a wire running by a
short cut from one binding post to the other, <i>s</i>
(<a href="#Fig14">Fig. 14</a>). Suppose <i>a</i> represents the wire around
the armature. Electricity, like water, goes more
readily through a big conductor than a small one
and more readily through a short than a long conductor.
If <i>s</i> and <i>a</i> were water pipes, each having
a stop-cock, we might easily adjust the cocks so that
one tenth of the water would go through <i>a</i> and
nine tenths through <i>s</i>. Or, indeed, without stop-cocks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the size and length of <i>s</i> and <i>a</i> might be so
apportioned that one tenth of the water would
flow through <i>a</i> and nine tenths through <i>s</i>. This
is precisely the adjustment which has been made
with reference to the flow of electricity
through this instrument. <i>s</i>
is called a 'shunt.' When the shunt
is out all the current goes through
<i>a</i> and when the shunt is in only
one tenth of the current goes through
<i>a</i>. I have two other shunts, each
of which may be put in the place of <i>s</i>.
With the second only one hundredth of the current
goes through <i>a</i> and with the third only one thousandth
of the current goes through <i>a</i>. Thus I
have an instrument which will measure anything
from one thousandth of an ampere up to ten
amperes.</p>

<p>"In this laboratory we pay about one cent for an
ampere of electricity for one hour. Twice as much
coal must be consumed to furnish two amperes as
one, and twice as much coal must be consumed to
furnish an ampere for two hours as for one hour.
Hence we need an instrument which will keep account
of time as well as amount of current. Such
an instrument we must look into next.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just before we pass to that, however, let me ask
if you have ever heard of a 'shunt-wound' dynamo.
Can you guess from the way we have just used the
word 'shunt' what the expression could mean with
reference to a dynamo?" Without hesitation the
boys told me that it meant that the field and armature
were wound parallel to one another, as shown
by diagram in <a href="#Fig15">Fig. 15</a>. In which case the electric
current which the machine
generates divides,
part of it going around
the field and part around
the armature. Another
type, called series-wound dynamos, is indicated by
diagram in <a href="#Fig16">Fig. 16</a>, in which case the electric current
goes through field
and armature in succession.
Under either of
these circumstances, how
can the armature move
with reference to the
field? The answer will
appear in the next
chapter.</p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV<br /><br />
<small>THE WATTMETER</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">We were</span> able to maintain connections
between the binding posts of the ammeter
and the movable armature of flexible wires
because the armature never moves more than one
third of a revolution, but we now wish to examine
an instrument in which the armature must not only
make a complete revolution but must continue to
revolve in the same direction indefinitely. How
are connections made so that an electric current
may pass from the fixed binding posts to the wire
of the moving coil? I will lift the cover off this
instrument, which is called a wattmeter, and let
you find the answer to that question.</p>

<p>I sent through the instrument the current from
a 32-candle-power lamp. According to the ammeter,
which was also in circuit, the amount was one
ampere.</p>

<p>The armature of the wattmeter revolved slowly
and it was not long before the boys reported that
connections for the current were made by strips of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
metal sliding on metal plates. The ends of the
armature wire were fastened one to one plate and
the other to the other plate, and the metal strips
brush along over the surfaces of the plates. (That
is why they are called "brushes," I said.) And
the brushes slide from one plate to the other each
time the armature makes half a revolution. (That
is, the brushes change the connection and thus
change the poles of the armature at the proper
instant so that they are always attracted to the
poles of the field toward which they are moving.)
This is called a commutator.</p>

<p>Notice that while the ammeter was like the
magneto in having a steel magnet for its field, the
wattmeter is like the dynamo in having electro-magnets
for both armature and field. Notice in
the second place that this instrument is an <i>electric
motor</i> since it is made to revolve by an electric
current. If it were made to revolve by some
other power it would generate electricity and would
then be called a dynamo. Indeed, let me tell
you something which must at present be nothing
more than a puzzle to you. <i>Every machine, while
it is being driven by an electric current as an electric
motor, is, at the same time, acting as a dynamo to generate
a current in the opposite direction.</i> Notice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
in the third place that this is a shunt-wound instrument.
The current which is sent into the instrument
divides, and part of it goes through the field,
while part goes through the armature. Motors,
as well as dynamos, are either shunt-wound or
series-wound. But notice finally that the axle
on which the armature is carried has a cyclometer
arrangement which keeps account of the number
of revolutions. The armature is going slowly enough
for us to count the revolutions. With watch
in hand we found that it made one hundred and
twenty revolutions per minute. I next brought the
current to the wattmeter through a 16-candle-power
lamp and the ammeter, connected in series, showed
that half an ampere was passing. We counted the
revolutions of the wattmeter and found them to
be sixty per minute.</p>

<p>Here, then, is a simple electric motor which
will register the amount of electricity we use.
It will register the same amount whether we use
one ampere for one hour or half an ampere for two
hours or two amperes for half an hour. In any
case this product is called <i>one ampere hour</i>. But
the words printed upon the dials of this instrument
are not <i>ampere hours</i>, but <i>watt hours</i> and the name
of the instrument is <i>wattmeter</i>. This next requires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
explanation. Follow me in a little roundabout
journey and the matter will be readily understood
when viewed from another approach.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_056.jpg" width="600" height="396" alt="" />
<a id="Fig17"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 17</div>
</div>

<p>When we were estimating the energy required
to climb the stairs of an apartment house, we
needed to take into account two factors, (1) our
weight and (2) the time which we took in climbing
them. The amount of coal burned, steam generated,
electricity produced, to
run our elevator depends
upon two factors,
(1) its weight and (2)
its speed. That idea is
fundamental. Let us
get at it in still another
way. Suppose
we have a mill pond,
(<a href="#Fig17">Fig. 17</a>, <i>A</i>). We construct
a penstock <i>p</i>
and install a water-wheel, <i>S</i>, to operate a mill. Our
business increases and we install more machinery
in our mill and must have more power to run it.
We have two ways of getting it, (1) we may lengthen
our wheel and enlarge our penstock so that a greater
weight of water will fall upon the wheel, or (2) we
may lengthen our penstock and move the wheel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
farther down so that the water will fall upon
the wheel with greater velocity. It is just so
with the electric current. Like water it is driven
on in its course by pressure. The unit for electric
pressure is called a volt. If we wish to drive the
wattmeter or any other electric motor twice as fast
as now, we may choose whether we shall do so by
doubling the volts of pressure or by doubling
the amperes of quantity.</p>

<p>The electric pressure on our mains is about one-hundred
and ten volts. We three together weigh 330
pounds. Our elevator brought us up stairs at the
speed of 100 feet per minute. It requires one horse-power
to raise 330 pounds 100 feet in a minute.
The ammeter in the engine room showed that 7
amperes of electricity were sent through the motor
of the elevator to bring us up. That is, seven
amperes at 110-volt pressure give one horse-power.
In the office building across the street where they
use a 220-volt current 3&frac12; amperes are required
to take us up stairs at the same speed. It is
necessary that the same amount of coal be consumed
to furnish the horse-power of energy whether
we supply it by means of seven amperes at 110
volts or 3&frac12; amperes at 220 volts. You notice that
the product is 770 in each case. The name given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
to this product is <i>watts</i>. More accurately 746
watts of electrical power are equivalent to one
horse-power. The name of this unit commemorates
the famous inventor of the steam engine,
James Watt (1736&ndash;1819). His monument now
overlooks the Clyde at his native town, Greenock,
Scotland.</p>

<p>To light a certain lamp, to heat a certain laundry
iron, to furnish a certain amount of power for an
electric motor, we must have a definite number
of watts. We may choose whether we will have
it at high or low voltage with correspondingly low
or high number of amperes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_058.jpg" width="600" height="158" alt="" />
<a id="Fig18"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 18</div>
</div>

<p>We will now connect with our laboratory current
a 32-candle-power lamp, an ammeter, and a wattmeter,
all in series, <a href="#Fig18">Fig. 18</a>, and in parallel with
these a volt meter. This last instrument indicates
the electric pressure. Its mechanism will be examined
later. The volt meter indicates 110 volts
and the ammeter shows that one ampere is passing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
The filament in the lamp resists the passage of the
current. It gets quite hot and gives forth as much
light as thirty-two candles. Its resistance is just
such that 110 volts of pressure send one ampere
through it. We will now take the reading of the
wattmeter, note the time and read it again later.
One hour later its index showed that 110 watt hours
of electrical energy had been converted into light
and heat. This at the usual rate, costs 1.1 cents,
one cent per hundred watt hours or ten cents per
thousand watt hours, called a kilowatt hour.
The more common 16-candle-power lamp costs
about half a cent an hour to operate. It requires
one horse-power to keep fourteen of them
burning.</p>

<p>I will now take you to see the wattmeter which
measures all the electric energy used in this building.
You note down its reading and the date
and the next time you come we will read it again
and thus find out how much electricity has been
used for electric lights, for electric ventilating
fans, for electric elevators, for electric ovens, and
electric irons in the school of household arts, for
electric motors to run lathes and other machines
in the school of technical arts, for electric experiments
in my laboratories and lecture room, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
electric vacuum cleaners and, lastly, for pumping
the pipe organ in chapel.</p>

<p>I saw by the boys' faces as they departed what
would be the next question that they would bring
to me. Knowing, however, that the hour was up,
they were too polite to press it then.</p>

<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V<br /><br />
<small>THE ELECTRIC MOTOR</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> a few days I received a telephone message,
asking if I could appoint an hour to meet the
programme committee in my laboratory. I must
confess that my pleasure in these meetings had increased
so much that I was quite ready to slight other
duties, if need be, to engage in them. Moreover,
since my business was education it was not difficult
for me to regard these meetings in the light of
a duty quite as important as my regular class
instruction&mdash;perhaps more effective. At any rate
the boys and I managed to get together. May
God forgive the man who essays to teach boys,
but does not love to be with them.</p>

<p>Of course at the last meeting of the Science
Club every one wanted to know how we ran a pipe
organ by electricity. Moreover the Electrical Show
was coming on in the city, and cows were to be
milked by electricity, dishes were to be washed
by electricity, rugs and furniture were to be cleaned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
by electricity, and innumerable distracting and
distressing things were to take place. I told the
boys that really only two kinds of things were to
be done by electricity at the show, and if they
would give me two one-hour appointments I
would furnish them with the key to the whole
show. We might as well begin to-day with the pipe
organ question.</p>

<p>A pipe organ is operated by air. It has bellows
which are simply one form of an air pump. A
boy is often employed to turn a crank which works
the bellows. Down in the basement underneath
our pipe organ I will show you how a half-horse-power
electric motor takes the place of a boy.
We found a dark and dirty corner where a boy
used to stand and turn a crank every time æsthetically
inclined people enjoyed an organ recital
in the room above. Science, which has not been
given credit for being <i>humanitarian</i>, put an electric
motor into that dark corner and sent the boy
up stairs to hear the music. The motor <i>grumbled</i>
at the dirt in the corner and compelled the janitor
to keep it clean.</p>

<p>The electric motor, better than any device I
know, enforces justice, but never requires mercy,
or at least rarely receives it. It comes nearer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
than any other machine to paying back all that
you put into it. It is most economical when working
up to its full capacity. I recommend that you
look it over carefully and after a few minutes tell
me what you have seen in it.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_065.jpg" width="350" height="295" alt="" />
<a id="Fig19"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 19</div>
</div>

<p>The boys said that it looked just like a dynamo.
We must not forget that it is a dynamo, but is
here used as a motor
by sending an electric
current through it.
This fact, that a
dynamo might be
driven by an electric
current and serve as
a mover of other
machinery, was first
publicly exhibited in 1873 at the Vienna Exhibition,
and by many believed to have been discovered by
accident at that exhibit. But why does it look like a
dynamo? It has a field whose magnetism is produced
by an electric current sent through coils of wire, and
it has an armature whose magnetism is likewise
produced by the electric current. If it were used
as a dynamo, where would it get the electric current
to magnetize its field? From its own moving
armature. Is it adapted for direct current? Yes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
It has a commutator and brushes. Is it shunt- or
series-wound? Shunt-wound, as shown by diagram
in <a href="#Fig20">Fig. 20</a>.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_066.jpg" width="300" height="448" alt="" />
<a id="Fig20"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 20</div>
</div>

<p>Suppose we treat the machine as a dynamo.
Bring the ends of the line wire together, thus,
as we say, closing the
circuit. By some external
force let us cause
the armature to rotate
and under the influence
of the magnetic field
it will generate an
electric current, part
of which will pass
through the field and
part through the line
circuit. We may adjust
the relative amount of
wire in field and line so
that any portion of the
current we choose will pass through the field. The
amount of current it will generate depends, (1)
upon the strength of the field and (2) upon the
speed of the armature. Its field, although never
entirely without magnetism, is very feeble at first,
and hence in the first instance a very small current<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
will be generated in the moving armature. This,
however, will strengthen the field slightly, and
as the field is strengthened the armature will
generate more current, and
thus by a mutual reaction the
machine gradually "builds
up" to full strength.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_067.jpg" width="300" height="420" alt="" />
<a id="Fig21"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 21</div>
</div>

<p>When now we use the machine
as a motor, an electric
current must be sent along
the line wires in the opposite
direction (<a href="#Fig21">Fig. 21</a>) from which
it would come out of the
machine when acting as a
dynamo. It will then be noticed that, although the
direction of the current through the field is the same,
whether the machine is used as a dynamo or a motor,
the direction through the armature, when used as a
motor, is the reverse of that when used as a dynamo.</p>

<p>You may perhaps be able to notice that the
amount of wire on the field is considerably more
than that on the armature. Now if you will trace
the wires carefully you will find that there is provided
a way of supplementing the wire of the
armature with some more wire in what is
called the rheostat, <a href="#Fig22">Fig. 22</a>. This wire, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
portions of it, is introduced into the armature
circuit when the machine first starts. When, however,
the machine has started and the armature
is moving within
the influence of a
magnetic field, it
plays the part of
a dynamo at the
same time that it
is acting as a
motor. Two conflicting
and opposite
electro-motive
forces therefore
exist in the
armature at the
same time. In <a href="#Fig22">Fig. 22</a> the arrow <i>a</i> represents the
direction of the electro-motive force which is
impressed upon the armature, and the arrow <i>b</i>
represents the counter-electro-motive force
which the moving armature develops.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_068.jpg" width="400" height="446" alt="" />
<a id="Fig22"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 22</div>
</div>

<p>This counter-electro-motive force, which develops
while the machine is in motion, makes it unnecessary
to hold back the current longer by the extra
resistance of the rheostat and hence that is usually
cut out. Being used only for starting purposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and looking like a box, it is generally called the
"starting box." If now it was intended that this
motor should run at a constant speed, as is often
the case, no other governor would be needed than
this counter-electro-motive force, for whenever the
machine begins to go faster, on account of reduced
load, its counter-electro-motive force increases as
the speed and holds in check the impressed electro-motive
force. This acts very perfectly as a governor,
and motors operate with notoriously constant
speed under variable loads. But, of course, in this
present instance the motor is required to work
at a variable speed. It must pump air slowly
for the soft passages of music, and it must work
the pump to its utmost for the very strong passages.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_070.jpg" width="600" height="566" alt="" />
<a id="Fig23"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 23</div>
</div>

<p>To understand how an electric motor may pump
an organ and have its speed automatically controlled,
let us examine the diagram in <a href="#Fig23">Fig. 23</a>. The
motor <i>m</i> causes the shaft <i>S</i> to revolve, carrying
the crank <i>C</i> around with it. The rod <i>r</i> causes <i>a b</i>,
the lower side of the bellows, to rise and fall, this
side being hinged at <i>b</i>. The side <i>b c</i>, is fixed.
When the side <i>a b</i> is pushed upward by the crank
rod the valve <i>f</i> closes and the air in the compartment
<i>h</i> pushes open the valve <i>g</i> and enters the
compartment <i>j</i>. The upper side <i>d e</i>, of this compartment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
rises as it is filled with air. Weights
<i>K</i>, <i>K</i>, <i>K</i>, rest on the top of this and air ducts
lead from this compartment to the pipes of the
organ. The keys of the organ operate air cocks
which open and close the air ducts connected
with the organ-pipes. A chain connected with
<i>e</i> passes around the axle of the wheel <i>l</i> and has
a weight <i>W</i> upon its lower end. The wheel <i>l</i>
carries a strip of brass <i>n</i>, which slides over metal
points <i>p</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>p</i>, etc. The successive points are connected
by coils of wire to furnish resistance. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
series of coils is called a rheostat. The wires <i>t</i> and
<i>u</i> form a loop from the armature of the motor
and connect this rheostat in series with the armature.
<i>u</i> is connected with the brass strip <i>n</i>.
Notice that when the compartment <i>j</i> is full of air
and the side <i>d e</i>, is lifted to its greatest height the
strip <i>n</i> is moved to the lowest point <i>p</i>, and the
electric current must pass from <i>u</i> through all
the resistance of the rheostat in order to get back
to the armature by the wire <i>t</i>. This makes the
motor go very slowly. When <i>d e</i> sinks down,
the strip <i>n</i> moves to the upper points <i>p</i>, and the
resistance is reduced step by step, enabling the
motor to quicken its speed and pump faster as
more air is required.</p>

<p>Small motors in order to be effective must
travel at high speed. This motor when moving
at its highest speed makes 1,800 revolutions per
minute. The bellows on the other hand needs to
be large and move slowly in order to be efficient.
Hence the motor is not in reality connected directly
to the shaft <i>S</i>, but causes the shaft to revolve
by means of a series of pulleys and belts. The
pulley on the motor is three inches in diameter.
It is connected by a flat leather belt with a wheel
thirty inches in diameter. When the motor therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
makes 1,800 revolutions per minute this wheel
makes 180 revolutions per minute. The axle of
this wheel carries a small cog-wheel three inches
in diameter and it is connected by a chain belt
with a cog wheel on the shaft <i>S</i> (<a href="#Fig23">Fig. 23</a>). Thus
this shaft revolves thirty times per minute, that
is, the rod <i>r</i> rises and falls each second. A pull
of one pound on the rim of the motor pulley
will cause a pull of sixty pounds on the cogs of the
wheel upon the shaft <i>S</i>. If the
second belt were leather, a sixty-pound
pull would cause it to
slip on the smaller pulley.
Hence the second belt is a steel
chain and the wheels have cogs,
or sprockets, like a bicycle.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_072.jpg" width="250" height="218" alt="" />
<a id="Fig24"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 24</div>
</div>

<p>The organist before beginning to play closes a
double-pole, single-throw switch (<a href="#Fig24">Fig. 24</a>), which
sends the electric current to the motor.</p>

<p>The motor pumps air until the bellows is full,
and if the organist delays playing, the strip of
brass <i>n</i> (<a href="#Fig23">Fig. 23</a>) is carried below the lowest
point <i>p</i>, thus cutting off the current and stopping
the motor. As soon as he uses some of the air
in the bellows, however, <i>n</i> rises and makes contact
with the points <i>p</i> and the motor starts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>This suggests that a somewhat similar thing is
accomplished under electric cars which have air
brakes. An electric motor pumps the air and
compresses it in a tank. When the pressure reaches
a certain point, say sixty pounds per square inch,
it automatically shuts off the electric current
from the motor which works the pump. But
when the motorman uses some of the air to apply
the brakes to the wheels, and the pressure in the
tank falls below sixty pounds, the electric current
is again automatically turned on to the
motor.</p>

<p>Of course if an electric motor can operate a
pump to compress air it may also work a pump
to exhaust air. This is what is done in a vacuum
cleaner. The electric pump as it is called (which
means a pump worked by an electric motor), exhausts
some of the air from a compartment in the machine,
and the atmosphere pressing in through nozzle
and hose carries dust from rugs and furniture
with it into the compartment. The best vacuum
cleaners will produce a pressure of seven or eight
pounds per square inch, about half an atmosphere.
This will remove dust from the warp and woof of
a rug better than our greatest hurricanes can when
the rugs are hung upon a line. There are three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
kinds of air pumps in use with vacuum cleaners:
(1) bellows, (2) rotating disk or fan, (3)
piston.</p>

<p>To milk cows by electricity is simply to apply
the vacuum-cleaner idea to the process, and, in
general, doing things by electricity usually means
doing them by some machine that is made to go by
an electric motor. This then is the first key to
the Electrical Show, and if you will remember to
look first for the motor it may remove much of the
mystery from some of the exhibits. In many
cases it is not necessary to have a complete electric
motor, but simply an electro-magnet to do the
work. In booth No. 56 you will find a piano
played by electricity. Its keys are moving,
but no hands strike them. There is no ghost at
work here. A little strip of iron has been placed
upon the under side of each key and a small electro-magnet
is placed under that. It is only necessary
that wires should run from these electro-magnets to
two dry-battery cells and to push buttons, and a
person far away may play the piano. In
reality, however, it is not a person but a roll
of punctured paper that opens and closes the
electric circuits to these various magnets underneath
the keys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>It often happens that you see a person playing
a pipe organ with his keyboard far removed from
the organ itself. In this case the keys simply act
as push buttons to close the electric circuit through
electro-magnets placed in the organ itself. These
electro-magnets operate the air valves of the various
pipes.</p>

<p>You call at some apartment house where there
is no hall boy, but a row of push buttons labelled
with the names of the tenants. You
push a button and the door which
was locked opens apparently of its
own accord. To say that the door
opens by electricity is only to add
mystery. What does happen is that
an electric bell up in the apartment
rings in response to your push of the
button, and in reply the tenant
pushes a button and the door is
unlatched by an electro-magnet concealed in
the door casing (<a href="#Fig25">Fig. 25</a>).</p>

<p>So I would say that the first key to the Electric
Show or to the multitude of electrical appliances
which you meet in life is the electro-magnet.
Consider the motor as one illustration of
its use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>If you are really to understand the Electric Show
you should go twice. I advise going with this
key alone first and note down all the applications
of electro-magnets which you can find there.
When you have done so I shall be glad to have
your report.</p>

<small>APPLICATIONS OF THE ELECTRO-MAGNET</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> became quite the rage now among the boys

</div>

<p>8. <i>The Electric Spinner</i> (<a href="#Fig26">Fig. 26</a>).&mdash;A toy full of
instruction. The standard is a steel magnet which
produces a magnetic field. Inside of this is an electro-magnet
which serves as an armature. Plainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
visible on its shaft is a commutator to which the
electric current from a dry cell is sent. This causes
the armature to revolve and carry with it a series
of colour disks which may be adjusted so as to show
what tint or shade results from mixing colours in
various proportions.</p>

</div>

<p>9. <i>The Electric Engine</i>
(<a href="#Fig27">Fig. 27</a>).&mdash;This toy, with
one dry battery cell, develops
power enough to run
several other toy machines.
The diagram in <a href="#Fig28">Fig. 28</a> will
make its plan of operation
plain. <i>B</i> is the battery cell,
<i>c</i> the electro-magnets, <i>a</i>
an armature of iron. By
a rod this armature is
connected with a crank on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the axle which carries the fly wheel <i>f</i>. Another
crank, <i>d</i>, upon the same axle serves like
a push button to close the electric circuit at
the right instant. The wire <i>g</i> from the battery
cell encircles the electro-magnet <i>c</i> and then is
connected to the iron base of the toy. When the
crank <i>d</i> touches the conductor <i>e</i>, which is a spring,
the electric current passes around the magnet, the
magnet pulls the iron armature <i>a</i>, and this gives an
impulse to the wheel <i>f</i> whose momentum carries it
around during that portion of the revolution when
<i>d</i> is separated from <i>e</i> and <i>a</i> is receding from the
magnet.</p>

<p>It is customary to say that the circuit is closed
through the base of the machine, but this language
requires interpretation.
It means that
a way is provided
for the electric current
to pass through
the base. A person
who is expert in
language but not in
electricity might expect us to say "the circuit is
open through the base."</p>

<p>10. <i>The Telegraph Sounder</i> (<a href="#Fig29">Fig. 29</a>).&mdash;This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
a toy half a century ago, but since the days of Samuel
Finley Breese Morse it has become of vast commercial
importance. The Western Union Telegraph
Company in 1909 had 211,513 miles of poles and
cables, 1,382,500 miles of wire, 24,321 offices, sent
68,053,439 messages, received $30,541,072.55, expended
$23,193,965.66, and had $7,347,106.89 in
profits. In the United States more than 93,000,000
and in the world at large more than 600,000,000
messages are sent annually, and there are men still
living who scoffed at Morse's ideas as <i>impracticable</i>.</p>

<p>It is interesting to contemplate what would
happen to the Stock Exchange, to the newspapers,
to the railroads, to the congressman addressing his
constituents from the floor of a legislative chamber,
to business in general, if the world were deprived
of the telegraph.</p>

<p>A few years ago a telegraph despatch was sent
from New York to San Francisco, Tokio, London,
and back to New York, 42,872 miles, in three minutes
less than an hour. Electricity can travel around
the world in a fraction of a second, the time was
consumed in repeating the message. I once sent a
message from New York to New Haven to announce
that I was coming, and afterward took my train
and reached New Haven in time to receive my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
message and pay the messenger boy. But I have
never lost faith in the beneficent results of Morse's
labours.</p>

<p>Morse (1791&ndash;1872) was an artist and the first
President of the National Academy of Design.
He was likewise a professor in New York University
and constructed his first experimental telegraph
line upon the University campus in 1835. His
first public line was built from Washington to Baltimore
in 1844. The Western Union Telegraph
Company was incorporated in 1856. Of course the
work of Morse rested upon that of Oersted, in Copenhagen,
who, in 1819, discovered electro-magnetism,
and upon that of Joseph Henry of Albany, who in
1827 first insulated the wires.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_081.jpg" width="600" height="194" alt="" />
<a id="Fig30"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 30</div>
</div>

<p>The application of the electro-magnet to producing
telegraphic signals will be understood by referring
to <a href="#Fig30">Fig. 30</a>. <i>B</i> is the generator of an electric current&mdash;sometimes
a battery and sometimes a dynamo.
One wire from this goes to the earth, <i>E</i>. The other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
wire goes through a key, which, like a push button
or a switch, serves to open or close the circuit.
This is normally closed when not in use. Through
this the current passes around the electro-magnet
<i>S</i>, which attracts the armature <i>a</i>, causing it to click
against a metal stop, hence it is called the sounder.
From this the current passes along the line wire to
a distant station and there through the sounder and
closed key to the earth. There is likely to be a
generator at each station. The current must run
continually through the system. If a battery is
employed, the copper sulphate, or gravity cell, to
be described later, is chosen, because it will endure
continued usage better than any other.</p>

<p>The operator, in sending signals, opens the circuit,
the magnets cease to hold down the armatures,
and they are raised by springs and strike against
metallic stops above. It is customary to say that
the circuit is completed through the earth. This
statement misleads some persons into imagining
an electric current capable of corroding water pipes
and decomposing chemical compounds, passing
through the earth between stations.</p>

<p>Perhaps it will help to a better understanding
of the truth if we think of a city pumping water out
of the ocean, say to fight fire, and disposing of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
again into the ocean. The ocean currents thus
produced are not likely to be destructive. Indeed,
just as we measure height from the ocean level as
zero, so we measure electric pressures as from the
zero level of the earth's electrical state.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_085.jpg" width="200" height="91" alt="" />
<a id="Fig31"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 31</div>
</div>

<p>The key used by telegraphers is represented in
<a href="#Fig31">Fig. 31</a>. It has
connected with it a
switch to keep the
circuit closed when
the key is not in
operation. The
Morse code of signals consists of dots and dashes,
when printed, as follows:</p>

<table class="tablecp4l" summary="morse">
<tr><td class="tplw">a</td><td>. -</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tplw">b</td><td>- . . .</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tplw">c</td><td>. .&nbsp;&nbsp;.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tplw">etc.</td><td></td></tr>
</table>

<p>Operators learn to read the message by the intervals
between sounds. A dot consists of two taps of
the sounder with a short interval between, and a
dash consists of two taps with a longer interval
between. One tap of the sounder is caused by its
descending upon the metal stop below and another
by its rising against the upper stop.</p>

<p>Telegraph sounders are operated on about a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
quarter of an ampere of current if from a battery
circuit, or on about one tenth of an ampere from a
dynamo circuit. The dynamo circuit is supplied
with more volts of electric pressure, and hence its
power is ample to cause the armature to strike the
metal stops hard enough to be heard by the
operator.</p>

<p>For example a battery circuit may supply to the
sounder a current with these characteristics:</p>

<p>2 volts × .25 amperes = .5 watts,</p>

<p>while a dynamo circuit may give:</p>

<p>6 volts × .1 ampere = .6 watts.</p>

<p>Telegraph line wires are usually bare, the insulation
being merely the glass knobs at the poles.
Clean water is a very good insulator but dirty water
is a fairly good conductor. A wet telegraph pole
may bring so much current to earth as to prevent
all sounders on the line from operating. Hence the
line is separated from the poles by glass. The
poles are about one hundred and thirty-two feet
apart, making forty to the mile. The wires are
usually galvanized iron one sixth of an inch in
diameter. Copper conducts six times as well as
iron, and is now replacing iron in the lines.</p>

<p>Morse laid a submarine telegraph line in New
York Harbour and suggested a cable across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
ocean. But that gigantic undertaking had to
await the masterful intelligence of Lord Kelvin and
the indomitable will of Cyrus W. Field. A submarine
cable was laid across the Strait of Dover
in 1850. It was cut by the anchor of a fisherman
a few hours after it was laid. The first attempt to
lay a submarine cable across the Atlantic Ocean was
made in 1857. Two ships of war, the <i>Agamemnon</i>
of Great Britain and the <i>Niagara</i> of the United
States, engaged in this undertaking. Three hundred
miles had been laid when the cable parted where the
ocean was more than two miles deep. William
Thomson was on board the <i>Agamemnon</i> as
electrical expert. He went home to study and
improve the methods. The next year, 1858, the
<i>Agamemnon</i> and the <i>Niagara</i> met in midocean
each with a portion of the cable on board.
The splice was made, and the <i>Agamemnon</i> started
toward Ireland and the <i>Niagara</i> toward Newfoundland.
When six miles apart the cable broke. The
ships met again, made a new splice and again
started in opposite directions. They laid eighty
miles and the cable parted a second time. They
met again, spliced and laid two hundred miles when
it parted for the third time. They met a fourth
time, made the splice and succeeded in laying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the first cable from Ireland to Newfoundland on
August 5, 1858.</p>

<p>In a few weeks the insulation failed and no more
messages could be sent. Seven years were spent in
studying the problem, and again in 1865 the <i>Great
Eastern</i>, a mammoth ship, started to lay the cable.
William Thomson was again on board as the expert.
When twelve hundred miles had been laid the cable
parted in deep water. Three times the cable was
grappled and brought part way to the surface and
lost again. The <i>Great Eastern</i> returned to land.
The next year, 1866, the <i>Great Eastern</i>, having on
board William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), Mr. Canning,
the engineer of the expedition, and Captain
Anderson, in command, laid the cable which has
worked successfully ever since. Thomson, Canning,
and Anderson were knighted as a result of their
labours. Sir William Thomson (1824&ndash;1907), afterward
Lord Kelvin, is credited with having solved
the difficult electrical problems connected with this
enterprise. Cyrus W. Field (1819&ndash;1892), born in
Stockbridge, Mass., helped to secure the many
millions of dollars necessary to carry the work to
completion.</p>

<p>There are now seventy-three cables connecting
Europe and America, and two across the Pacific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Ocean. Cable rates are: New York to England,
France, Germany, or Holland twenty-five cents a
word, to Switzerland thirty cents a word, and to
Japan one dollar and thirty-three cents a word.</p>

<p>The boys were kept very busy now looking up
historical and biographical sketches, as well as
working up the many applications of the electro-magnet.
The next to be reported was:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">

<a id="Fig32"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 32</div>
</div>

<p>11. <i>The Relay</i> (<a href="#Fig32">Fig. 32</a>).&mdash;Telegraphing from
3,000 to 10,000 miles under the ocean is full of difficulties
not now to be explained.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_090.jpg" width="250" height="100" alt="" />
<a id="Fig33"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 33</div>
</div>

<p>Of course when we attempt to telegraph many
miles upon land we find that the resistance of the
wire cuts down the strength of the current so that
it will not move the sounder. This, however, is
readily obviated by the relay devised by Morse.
It simply serves as an automatic key to close a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
circuit. A diagram will make this clear (<a href="#Fig33">Fig. 33</a>).
Suppose the line wire to be very long and on account
of its resistance the current is too feeble to operate
a sounder. It is likely to be about .025 ampere
where the local sounder may require .25 ampere
or ten times as much. It is easily possible to wind a
magnet (<a href="#Fig33">Fig. 33</a>), <i>R</i>, such that .025 ampere will
close the armature <i>a</i>, so that it may complete a
local circuit when it would
not make noise enough for a
sounder. <i>B</i> may represent a
local battery of any desired
strength which may operate
the sounder <i>S</i> of that station
as loudly as may be desired.</p>

<p>12. <i>Annunciator</i> (<a href="#Fig34">Fig. 34</a>).&mdash;We
live in a fifth-floor
apartment. When we push<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the button to call the elevator a No. 5 appears
in the annunciator in the elevator car. This tells
the elevator boy where the call comes from. Take
out two or three screws and the annunciator opens,
revealing a series of electro-magnets
like the one shown in
<a href="#Fig35">Fig. 35</a>. When an electric current
passes around the coil it
pulls back an iron catch and
allows a number to drop so as
to show through a small window.
The elevator boy, having noted that the call
is from the fifth floor, pushes up the number and
the iron catch holds it until the coil is magnetized
again by an electric
current.</p>

<a id="Fig37"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 37</div>
</div>

<p>The annunciator has a
bell to call attention. A
cable of six wires enters
this annunciator (<a href="#Fig36">Fig. 36</a>).
One wire goes direct to the
bell and the other five
reach the bell through the
separate coils of the electro-magnets
which control
the drops. But how are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
electrical connections made between a moving
elevator car and the push buttons on various floors?
The diagram in <a href="#Fig37">Fig. 37</a> shows this in elevation.
<i>B</i> represents a battery of several dry cells located
in the basement. One wire from
it runs direct to the push buttons
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, located upon
the five floors of the house. The
other wire from the battery, together
with wires from each of the
five push buttons, all run to a
point, <i>A</i>, half-way up the elevator
shaft. Here the six wires are
gathered into a cable long enough
to reach either to the top or the
bottom of the elevator shaft.
The other end of this cable enters
the elevator car and runs to
the annunciator. The wire from
the battery goes direct to the
bell. The wires from the various
push buttons go through correspondingly
numbered electro-magnets
to the bell. When, therefore, we
pushed the button on the fifth floor, we closed the
gap in the electric circuit at that point. The current<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
came up from the battery, passed through the
button, went down the cable to the car, went through
electro-magnet No. 5, went through the bell, and
returned direct to the battery, thus completing the
circuit. Annunciators are used about buildings
to call other attendants, besides the elevator boy.
They are likewise used in burglar alarms to inform
the householder which door or window is being forced.
They are used in the fire department to tell what
part of the city the call came from.</p>

</div>

<p>13. <i>The Electric Bell and Buzzer</i> (<a href="#Fig38">Fig. 38</a>).&mdash;So
common a thing as an electric bell really belongs to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the present generation. Bells were either novelties
or toys when I was your age. They cost then many
times what they do now and then were poorly made.
Nobody dared to trust them for front-door bells.
It was necessary to have a card permanently posted
over the push button saying, "If the bell does not
ring, knock." In those days batteries were troublesome
to care for, houses were not wired when built,
and no one had learned the art of concealing the
wires neatly.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_094.jpg" width="300" height="544" alt="" />
<a id="Fig39"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 39</div>
</div>

<p>The buzzer is simply a bell minus gong and hammer.
Those shown in <a href="#Fig38">Fig. 38</a> ring well on a single
dry cell. A cell costing twelve cents operated one
for two years while it was used as
a call bell from dining room to
kitchen, the current required being
.15 ampere.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 413px;">
<a id="PL5"></a><img src="images/i_095.jpg" width="413" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Electric Bell</div>
</div>

<p>The connections are shown in the
diagram (<a href="#Fig39">Fig. 39</a>). Suppose the current
to enter at the binding post <i>a</i>,
pass around the magnets <i>b</i> and
then to the post <i>c</i>. The armature
<i>d</i> normally rests against the post
<i>c</i> and the current finds its way
along this to the post <i>e</i> and thence back to the
battery. But as soon as the current passes, <i>b</i> becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
a magnet and pulls the armature <i>d</i> away
from the post <i>c</i>, thus breaking the circuit, when <i>b</i>
ceases to be a magnet and a spring pushes the
armature <i>d</i> back against the post <i>c</i> to repeat
the operation. The armature <i>d</i> carries a hammer
which strikes the gong <i>f</i>. If the wire, which is
usually connected with the binding post <i>e</i>, is connected
with the post <i>c</i>, the "clatter" bell is
changed to a "single-stroke" bell, and if the gong
and hammer are removed the "bell" is changed to
a "buzzer."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_097.jpg" width="350" height="97" alt="" />
<a id="Fig40"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 40</div>
</div>

<p>In the case of the buzzer, by changing the length
of the armature or by weighting it, we may change
the time of its vibrations and its tone. The connections
between battery push button and bell form a
complete circuit. In <a href="#Fig40">Fig. 40</a> <i>B</i> represents a battery,
usually of dry cells,
<i>B'</i> represents the bell,
and <i>P</i> represents the
push button. The
electric circuit is "open," (that is, there is a break
in the conductor) at <i>P</i> until some one "pushes the
button," that is, simply pushes against a spring
so as to cause a piece of metal to bridge the gap
in the conductor. Then we say the circuit is
"closed."</p>

<p>Push button devices and switches are innumerable.
In every case they are simply devices for pushing
one piece of metal against another and completing
the circuit for an electric current. Every one should
unscrew and examine a few of them, both for the
pleasure of seeing how they work and to learn how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
to make them work when they sometimes fail.
Not only in bells but in all other instruments where
electro-magnets are used, the magnets are placed
in pairs, fastened together upon an iron base. They
are wound so that the free ends are made opposite
poles by the electric current. Like a horseshoe
magnet, they form one magnet. The two poles
thus placed are mutually helpful and each is
stronger than it would be if separated from the other.</p>

It had an electro-magnet like that in <a href="#Fig44">Fig. 44</a>. A strip
of iron acting as an armature across the free ends of
this magnet, pushed like a finger against the cogs of
a wheel. This wheel was on the axle of the minute
hand and it had sixty
cogs. The electric
circuit was closed
through the magnet
for an instant each
minute and the armature
pushed the wheel
ahead one cog. Thus
it made one complete revolution in an hour. A
train of four other cog-wheels caused the hour hand
to trail after at one twelfth the speed of the minute
hand. This machinery made simply a small handful
in an eighteen-inch stamped-metal "dish-pan"
costing fifteen dollars.</p>

<p>A self-winding clock was opened and found to
contain two dry battery cells, an electro-magnet
which operated very much like that of a "clatter"
bell, the hammer like a finger poking against the
cogs of a wheel. Once an hour the long hand
closed the circuit through the battery and the magnet
and its armature swung back and forth long enough
to give the cog wheel one complete revolution and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
wind a spring, which it carried upon its axle. This
spring kept the clock running one hour, until the
next winding.</p>

<p>The programme clocks which were examined were
self-winding clocks, but were connected by wires to
the master clock which corrected them each hour.
Each time the long hand of the master clock came
to twelve it closed an electric circuit through all
the clocks in the system.
In each clock
the current passed
around an electro-magnet
and caused it to
pull an armature
against a metal stop
and set each long hand
exactly at twelve.
This master clock is
sometimes situated
many miles away and
may correct the time
for a whole city. Thus
a master clock at
Washington, D. C.,
furnishes standard time
to all parts of the United States. The master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
clock which we examined also closed the circuit
at proper intervals through a series of programme
bells placed in the various class rooms, and these
called and dismissed classes automatically.</p>

device to compel a watchman to make his appointed
trips. Push buttons
or switches
are distributed
about the building
at various
points, and it is
made his duty to
close the circuits
at these points
at stated times.
When he does so,
the fact is recorded
by electro-magnets
puncturing,
or, in some
way, marking a revolving time card in the clock.</p>

are used to open switches and thus protect dynamos
and other machines against a larger electric current
than they are able to carry. The switch is held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
closed by a spring which, by an adjusting device,
may be tightened or loosened. A dynamo which
we examined had its circuit breaker adjusted so
that it would remain closed if any current under
1500 amperes passed, but if a greater current than
that passed it would strengthen the magnet sufficiently
to open the switch and thus
break the circuit.</p>

<p>17. <i>Separating Iron from
Ore.</i>&mdash;In 1897 Edison first
proposed to use an electro-magnet
to separate iron
from crushed earth.
<a href="#Fig47">Fig. 47</a> represents
the process. <i>E</i> is
an electro-magnet.
<i>S</i> is the stream of
crushed ore containing
iron. Gravity
would cause all the material to fall into bin <i>A</i>, but
the electro-magnet <i>E</i> pulls that portion of the
material which is magnetic to one side so that it
falls into the bin <i>B</i>.</p>

<p>18. <i>Lifting Magnets.</i>&mdash;Electro-magnets are made
for use with hoisting apparatus to save the trouble
of manipulating grappling hooks, etc. They may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
lift barrels and boxes of iron, the wood of the barrel
or box being transparent, we say, to the magnetic
influence. That is, the magnet will attract iron
through the wood just as light will shine through
glass. Such magnets are used to pick up from the
bottom of the sea cases of hardware from wrecked
ships. (See the accompanying illustration, <a href="#Fig48">Fig. 48</a>.)
In such cases the electric conductors which lead to
and encircle the magnets must be well insulated
from the water of the sea, otherwise the electric
current would take the shorter path from one line
wire through the sea water, which is a fairly good
conductor, and back by the
other line wire, rather than
go the path of greater
resistance around the
magnet. Electro-magnets
are coming into use in
foundries, etc., for lifting
heavy iron castings.</p>

<p>19. <i>Electro-Magnet on
Starting Box.</i>&mdash;As was explained
under <i>electric motors</i>, a starting box is simply
a series of resistance coils <i>r</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>r</i>, in <a href="#Fig49">Fig. 49</a>.
When the motor is not in use the switch <i>l</i> rests
upon the point 1 and no electric current passes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
When the switch is moved to point 2, the current
entering at <i>a</i> passes to the pivot of the switch and
up the metal strip <i>l</i> to the point 2, then around
the series of coils, <i>r</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>r</i>, to the post <i>b</i> and thence
back to the generator. As the switch is moved
to the right, the current passes through less and
less of this resistance until, when it reaches point
7, all the coils of resistance are "cut out,"
that is, they are not in the path of the current.
Now the motor has reached its full speed and is
developing enough counter-electro-motive force to
protect itself against too much current. Through
a shunt, however, a portion of the current passes
from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> around the electro-magnet <i>e</i>, the two
poles of which are presented to the metal
strip <i>l</i>, which must be of iron. This magnet
holds the switch over so long as the current is
on, but when the current is cut off, by opening
a switch in the line wire, <i>e</i> ceases to be a magnet
and <i>l</i> is carried back to point 1 by a spring.
Thus an extra resistance must always be in
circuit when the motor is first started. Those
who start motors are expected to move the
lever <i>l</i> of the starting box slowly from point
to point, pausing a second or two on each to give the
motor time to acquire proper speed for its protection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
How too great a current would "burn out"
a motor will be explained later.</p>

<p>The motor man handles a lever for starting his
car, which works like that of the "starting box."
His "starting box," however, is called a "controller."
Although it accomplishes the same result as the
starting box it has a wholly different and vastly
more complex mechanism than that already
described.</p>

<p>The elevator boy, who runs our electric elevator,
handles a lever which also does the same thing
through far different mechanism. Indeed, in his
case electro-magnets are used to prevent him from
cutting out resistance too fast if he should move his
lever too quickly.</p>

<p>20. <i>Starting Switches for Electric Elevators.</i>&mdash;The
motor man has to be instructed particularly how he
should handle the lever of his controller, and he is
trusted to follow his directions to some extent,
however lacking in intelligence and integrity he
may be. But the elevator boy receives scarcely
any instructions about his machine, and, indeed, his
machine has been constructed pretty nearly "foolproof."
It will automatically correct his errors
of management. If he throws the handle from one
extreme to the other, all resistance cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
thrown out instantly, but this is accomplished by a
series of electro-magnets closing one switch after
another and thus cutting out resistance gradually.</p>

<p>21. <i>Arc Lamp Feed.</i>&mdash;As will be explained later, an
arc lamp must have its carbons touching one another
when the current is first thrown on, and then the
carbons must be drawn apart from a quarter to
half an inch. The upper carbon is lifted away from
the lower one by a portion of the current passing by
means of a shunt around an electro-magnet.</p>

<p>22. <i>Volt meter.</i>&mdash;The volt meter measures the pressure
of an electric current. The volt meter which we
examined looked outside like our ammeter, and
when we removed the face it appeared inside like
an ammeter. There was the steel magnet of horseshoe
shape to furnish a field (<a href="#Fig51">Fig. 51</a>), and there was
an electro-magnet poised between its poles for an
armature. The armature in the volt meter, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
had wound upon it finer wire and more of it than
was the case in the ammeter. There was no shunt
wire in the volt meter
as there
was in the
ammeter. We
connected in
series a fluid
cell (to be described
later), the ammeter, and
the volt meter (<a href="#Fig52">Fig. 52</a>).
The ammeter shunt was
removed so that all the
current went through its
armature. The volt meter
needle went to
one which was two
thirds of the scale (<a href="#Fig53">Fig.
53</a>), and the ammeter
needle indicated .016.
That is, this particular
cell can push sixteen
thousandths of an
ampere through the
resistance of this volt meter,
and .016 ampere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
passing through the armature of this volt meter
will magnetize it sufficiently to move it against
its spring, say sixty degrees.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_110.jpg" width="400" height="118" alt="" />

<a id="Fig54"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 54</div>
</div>

<p>We put into the circuit a lot more fine wire for
resistance, <i>R</i> (<a href="#Fig54">Fig. 54</a>), so that the volt meter needle
went only half as far as
before, that is to .5. The
ammeter indicated only half
as much as before, that is
.008 ampere. We put in
resistance enough to bring the
volt meter needle down to .25
and the ammeter indicated one quarter of the original
current. We put in less resistance, bringing the volt meter
needle to .75, and the ammeter indicated three
fourths of the original current. Evidently the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
volt meter is merely an ammeter with a different
scale marked upon its card. With a pen we marked
upon the card of the volt meter a true ammeter
scale (<a href="#Fig55">Fig. 55</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_111.jpg" width="200" height="509" alt="" />
<a id="Fig56"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 56</div>
</div>

<p>In order to understand the volt meter, let us
turn our attention for a moment to <a href="#Fig56">Fig. 56</a>. I
have arranged the water tank <i>T</i> at such a height
above the faucet <i>F</i> that when the
faucet is opened one quart of
water will flow in a minute. If I
partially close the faucet, making
the opening one half as large (that
is, offering twice the resistance to
the flow), half a quart will flow in a
minute. If I make the resistance
four times as great only one quarter
of a quart will flow in a minute. It
is evident that I could arrange a
scale underneath the handle of the
faucet to indicate the quantity of
water flowing, just as the ammeter
and volt meter indicate the quantity
of electricity which flows. If now that much is understood,
it will be easy to learn how the water faucet may
be used to measure water pressure and the volt meter
in like manner used to measure electric pressure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Having set the faucet so that a quart will flow
per minute, let us put on a longer tube <i>p</i>, and move
the tank up to another shelf so that the distance
from the water level in the tank to the faucet is
twice as great as before. Under the increased
pressure water runs through the faucet twice as
fast and we now get two quarts per minute.</p>

<p>I purposely placed the tank out of sight behind
a partition so that you might practise judging the
water pressure by the flow at the faucet. We
cannot very well talk about pressure in quarts.
We might talk about it in pounds, but if we used
this apparatus much we should probably get into
the habit of talking about the pressure from one
shelf, two shelves, three shelves, etc.</p>

<p>In order that the pressure might remain nearly
constant during the experiment we would probably
introduce resistance (that is, partially close the
faucet) so that the water level should not fall
much. We might, for example, set the faucet
so that half a pint would flow in a minute when the
tank was on the first shelf. Then a pint per minute
would flow when the tank was on the second shelf
and one and a half pints per minute when the tank
was on the third shelf, etc. Thus we should infer
the pressure by measuring the quantity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>One more illustration and the case will be clear.
To save the trouble of measuring the quantity of
water which flows through the faucet, suppose I
introduce the device represented in <a href="#Fig57">Fig. 57</a>. <i>W</i> is
a small water wheel comparable
to the armature of the
volt meter. It carries a pointer
which moves over a scale just
as in the case of the volt meter.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_113.jpg" width="250" height="342" alt="" />
<a id="Fig57"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 57</div>
</div>

<p>It has a spring coiled around
its axle which tends to keep
the pointer at <i>0</i>, as in the case
of the volt meter. The tank
is placed upon the first shelf,
the faucet is fixed so that a
small amount of water flows and the needle moves to a
certain figure upon the scale. We will mark this point
one and call it "first-shelf pressure." The tank is
lifted to the second shelf and the index moves to
another point, which we will mark two and call it
"second-shelf pressure." The tank is lifted to the
third shelf and the index moves to a third point,
which we will mark three and call it "third-shelf
pressure," etc.</p>

<p>Ordinarily we measure water pressure with an
instrument which allows no water to run to waste,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
but in measuring electric pressure by the volt meter
some current must pass through the instrument,
just as in the case of our water-wheel illustration
in <a href="#Fig57">Fig. 57</a>. We put in large resistance so as to make
this current as small as possible, while we let enough
pass to move the armature.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_114.jpg" width="250" height="212" alt="" />
<a id="Fig58"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 58</div>
</div>

<p>Now let us return to the volt meter itself. By
referring to <a href="#Fig55">Fig. 55</a>, we see that it requires .024
ampere to move the needle of
the volt meter clear across the
scale, and we have found that
one fluid cell was able to send
enough current through the
resistance of the armature
to move the needle two thirds
of the way across the scale. At this point we
find <a href="#Fig1">Fig. 1</a>, which might be read "one-cell
pressure." We prefer to commemorate the name
of one of the workers in the field of electricity
and call this pressure a "volt" after Alessandro
Volta (1745&ndash;1827), born at Como, Italy. It is
the electric pressure which is produced by one fluid
cell of a certain kind. We say, then, that one volt
pushes through the resistance of this armature
.016 ampere. Half a volt would push through the
resistance of the armature half as much current<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
or .008 ampere. At this point we put .5. Thus
each of the figures in the lower row (<a href="#Fig55">Fig. 55</a>) shows
what part of a volt is required to send enough
current through this particular armature to move
the needle to that point.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_115.jpg" width="250" height="216" alt="" />
<a id="Fig59"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 59</div>
</div>

<p>We found out how much wire was wound upon
the armature and put exactly the same amount in
the outside resistance, <i>R</i> (<a href="#Fig59">Fig. 59</a>). The needle now
showed that one volt is able
to push through twice the
resistance of the armature
only half as much current,
and the needle stopped at
.008 ampere. If this were
to be the resistance in the
volt meter circuit one volt should stand under .008
ampere and two under .016 and three under .024. It
is evident then, that, if we know the internal resistance
of a volt meter, we may make it capable of measuring
greater electrical pressures by adding the proper
amount of resistance. By putting at <i>R</i>, (<a href="#Fig59">Fig. 59</a>)
nine times the internal resistance of the instrument,
thus multiplying the total resistance tenfold, the
figures upon the scale of volts may be read as whole
numbers from one to fifteen. In this case it will
require fifteen cells to push the needle clear across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the scale and ten cells to push it two thirds
of the way across. If now we add enough
external resistance to multiply the resistance
of the armature a hundred fold it will require
150 volts to push .024 of an ampere through
the armature and pull its needle clear across
the scale. In this case the figures upon the
scale of volts are multiplied by one hundred and
read from ten to one hundred and fifty. Such
a scale would adapt this volt meter for use with
our 110-volt lighting circuit. Volt meters are made
with a series of such external resistances, called
"multipliers," attached so that they may be easily
thrown into the circuit.</p>

<p>It is evident that we need some term so that we
may speak of quantities of resistance. This need
has given rise to a unit of resistance called an
ohm, after George Simon Ohm (1789&ndash;1854) born
at Erlanger in Bavaria. Two inches of No. 36
German silver wire, such as is wound upon the
armature of this volt meter, gives one ohm of
resistance. There are 125 inches of this wire
upon the armature. Its resistance is, therefore,
62.5 ohms, and we may, therefore, say that one volt
of electric pressure can push through 62.5 ohms of
resistance .016 of an ampere of current. Ohm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
discovered this relationship in 1827, and formulated
it as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
volts/ohms = amperes (not, however, using these words).<br />
<br />
(1 volt)/(62.5 ohms) = .016 ampere.<br />
<table class="tablel" summary="long division">

<p>Volt meters and armatures for the alternating
current have electro-magnets for their fields as well
as for their armatures. Such
instruments are equally well
adapted for either direct or
alternating currents. For when
the current reverses its direction
it reverses in field and
armature alike, and thus a
repulsion between like poles is
maintained. Such an instrument, however, cannot
respond to as slight a current as those previously
described, since they must consume some energy
in both field and armature.</p>

stretch neither of the imagination nor of the truth
to call a telephone receiver an electro-magnet,
although perhaps it has never been called that
before. We took it apart and found that it consisted
of a steel-bar magnet
<i>m</i> (<a href="#Fig62">Fig. 62</a>), with a
small spool of wire <i>w</i>
around one end of it.
The ends of the wire
on the spool run along inside the hard rubber
shell to the two binding posts <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> at the other
end. A disk of sheet iron <i>S</i> is held in the large
end of the case very near to, but not quite touching,
the end of the magnet.
When an alternating
current is sent through
the wire upon the spool
it causes rapid changes
in the strength of the
magnetic field, if not reversals of the poles of the
field, and the iron disk is made to vibrate, keeping time
with the alternations of the current.</p>

<a id="Fig62"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 62</div>

<p>In this laboratory we have seen that our current
has sixty alternations per second. When it is
connected with the receiver the disk, therefore,
makes sixty vibrations per second, and produces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
a tone which has very nearly the pitch of C two
octaves below the middle C upon the piano.</p>

<p>24. <i>Spark Coil</i> (<a href="#Fig63">Fig. 63</a>).&mdash;The automobile spark
coil which we have already used is an electro-magnet.
The battery sends a current
through wire coiled
around an iron core.
At one end of this iron
core is an iron armature
which is made to vibrate
in precisely the same
manner as the armature
of an electric bell. This
makes and breaks the
current and causes rapid
changes in the strength
of the field. A rapidly
changing magnetic field
may be used to develop
electricity in a conductor,
as we have already seen in the case of the dynamo.</p>

<p>How it is used in the automobile spark coil will
be shown later. It is sufficient now to mention it
as a case of a magnetic field produced by an electric
current passing through a wire coiled around an
iron core, or, in short, an electro-magnet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Induction coils, Ruhmkorff coils, and transformers,
to be described later, are closely related to this.
They all create magnetic fields in the same way and
are all electro-magnets.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> was Washington's birthday. The schools
were to have a holiday and the Science Club
was to hold a special, open meeting at which I
had been asked to present the subject of electricity
in the household. I replied to the programme committee
that that was too large a subject, but that I
would talk upon electric heating. I warned them,
however, that it would be a dry study, and not
an entertainment. They replied that the father
of his country had been born at a time of the year
when the weather was unfavourable to outdoor
sports, and that February usually found them
acclimated to vigorous study. Neither they nor
their friends objected to study if it seemed to have
a motive.</p>

<p>I found an audience composed of old and young,
men and women, girls and boys. Most of them had
left school&mdash;many of them because their teachers
thought they were incompetent to continue.</p>

</div>

<p>Not far from here is "a wheel in the middle of a
wheel ... as for their rings they are so high that
they are dreadful ... and the spirit of the living
creature is in the wheels." Those wheels are now
sending the electric current to this room for our experiments.
I propose to show that we convert electricity
into heat by offering resistance to its flow. Experience
teaches us that resistance to motion always produces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
heat. At Niagara Falls thousands of tons of water descend
at the rate of one hundred and sixty feet in three
seconds. When the water reaches the bottom of the
falls, it is moving a little faster than a mile a minute.
The resistance which this mass meets after its fall retards
its motion and generates heat.</p>

<p>Hundreds of meteors fall into our atmosphere daily,
travelling a thousand times as fast as the waters of
Niagara Falls. The resistance to their motion, which
our atmosphere offers, heats them white hot, melts
them, vaporizes them, burns them up, so that very
few of them reach the solid earth in a solid condition.</p>

<p>An iron spile driver, measuring two cubic feet,
weighs about half a ton. When it falls sixteen feet
upon the end of a spile it is moving at the rate of
twenty miles an hour. The energy of this moving
mass depends upon both its weight and its velocity,
and when its motion is arrested by the spile that energy
of motion is largely converted into heat energy,
from which both the spile and the spile driver get hot.</p>

<p>A piece of iron may be made red hot by pounding
it with a trip hammer.</p>

<p>Count Rumford found, in 1798, while boring cannon
in the arsenal at Munich, that the resistance
which the iron offered to the motion of the boring
tool furnished heat enough to boil water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Seven hundred and seventy-eight foot pounds of
mechanical energy when converted into heat would
raise one pound of water (one pint) one degree. This is
called the British thermal unit. The spile driver,
weighing 1000 pounds, falling 16 feet upon a spile, produces
heat enough to raise 1 pint of water 20 degrees.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_124.jpg" width="600" height="139" alt="" />
<a id="Fig66"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 66</div>
</div>

<p>Here are two binding posts, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, 8 feet
apart (<a href="#Fig66">Fig. 66</a>), connected by copper wires with
the dynamo circuit. The volt meter indicates 112
volts of pressure. I will close the circuit by stretching
between <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> 8 feet of No. 24 iron wire.
(This wire is about the thickness of a common pin.)
The iron wire offers resistance to the flow of the electric
current, thereby producing heat&mdash;heat enough
as you see to make the wire white hot, indeed heat
enough to raise it to something over two thousand
degrees Fahr., for now you see it has melted.</p>

<p>We will put in a fresh piece of wire and connect
also the ammeter in the circuit (<a href="#Fig67">Fig. 67</a>). As I close
the circuit the needle of the ammeter at first indicates
20 or 30 amperes, but in a second drops to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
8 amperes, and remains there a second until the wire
melts and falls apart. One hundred and twelve volts
of electric pressure are able to push 8 amperes of
electricity through this wire when hot.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_125.jpg" width="600" height="166" alt="" />
<a id="Fig67"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 67</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
(112 volts)/(14 ohms) = 8 amperes<br />
<br />
112 volts × 8 amperes = 896 watts<br />
<br />
746 watts = one horse-power<br />
<br />
</div>

<p>Hence it required about one and one fifth horse-power
to melt the wire in a second, and the heat produced
was a little less than one British thermal unit,
a unit much used by engineers.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1 pound raised 1 foot = 1 foot pound</p>

<p>550 foot pounds per second = 1 horse-power</p>

<p>778 foot pounds (1.4 H.-P.) = 1 B. T. U. (British thermal
unit) = heat required to raise 1 pound of water
1° Fahrenheit</p>

<p>1 volt × 1 ampere = 1 watt</p>

<p>746 watts = 1 horse-power</p>
</div>

<p>In order to hold back 112 volts of electric pressure
so that not more than eight amperes of electricity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
should pass, the iron wire must have offered about
14 ohms of resistance.</p>

<p>The behaviour of the ammeter needle showed that
the wire offered very much less resistance when
cold than when hot. Indeed eight feet of No.
24 iron wire offers about one and one third ohms
resistance when cold, hence heat had increased
its resistance to the passage of the electric current
tenfold.</p>

<p>This piece of iron wire offered resistance to the
flow of the electric current. It offered resistance
to the motion of the dynamo. This offered resistance
to the steam-engine which drives the
dynamo. This caused the governor of the engine
to open and pass more steam from the boiler. This
reduced the pressure at the steam gauge. This
caused the fireman to shovel more coal into the
furnace. The heat of the burning coal melts the
wire, but it does it only after several changes. First,
it is converted into mechanical energy in the steam-engine
with great loss&mdash;about nine tenths being
lost. Second, it is converted into electrical energy
by the dynamo, with some loss, and, third, it is
conducted to the iron wire and converted back
to heat with still further loss. It is evident that the
most economical way to heat the wire would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to take it to the furnace. Yet all electric cooking
is done by sending electric current through wires
embedded in the walls of the cooking utensils, and
it is the most wasteful method of using the energy
stored in coal that has yet been devised.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_127.jpg" width="400" height="361" alt="" />
<a id="Fig68"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 68</div>
</div>

<p>That merely connecting the binding posts <i>a</i> and
<i>b</i> (<a href="#Fig67">Fig. 67</a>) by a small piece of wire should throw a
load upon the dynamo miles away; should offer
resistance to its motion, and make it require 1.18
horse-power more of energy to keep up its speed
of revolution, is, indeed, uncanny. I will attempt to
make it seem more real. At one end of the lecture
table I have a rotary pump <i>P</i> (<a href="#Fig68">Fig. 68</a>). The end
of the rubber tube <i>a</i>, which leads to the pump<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
is lying upon the table outside of the tank of
water, <i>T</i>. While things are in this condition I
move the crank which operates the pump with
perfect ease. Now while still turning the crank
I pick up the tube <i>a</i> and drop its free end into the
water tank. I cannot now conceal the fact, even
if I were disposed to do so, that I must work hard
to keep the pump going. The pump itself tells you
by its laboured sound that it is working hard, and
the stream of water which issues from the pipe <i>b</i>
tells how much work I am performing. The pump
is discharging five and a half pints of water per
second, that is 5.5 pounds, and it raises this water
10 feet. Hence I am doing 55 foot pounds of work
per second, which requires one tenth of a horse-power.
Here is a lad who consents to try the
experiment for us. He turns the crank easily
while I am holding the tube <i>a</i> out of the water, but
when I lower it into the water he finds the resistance
so great that, tug however much he may, he is
unable to keep the pump going.</p>

<p>At the other end of the table I have a small hand
dynamo, <i>D</i> (<a href="#Fig68">Fig. 68</a>), <i>M</i> is an ammeter, <i>V</i> is a volt meter,
<i>S</i> is a switch. All the wires are good-sized
copper, and offer little resistance, except that
stretched between the binding posts <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
is a piece of fine German silver wire. While the switch
is open I turn the crank of the dynamo with perfect
ease. A small amount of current is going through
the volt meter, but this is too slight to offer any
perceptible resistance to the motion of the machine.</p>

<p>Notice that the volt meter needle moves according
to the speed of revolution. If I turn the crank
once a second the needle stands at 25 volts. The
electric pressure increases or decreases according
to whether I rotate the armature faster or slower.
Now I will attempt to keep the machine revolving
at a constant rate while I close the switch <i>S</i>, and
surely you must see that I have hard work to do so.
The wire <i>a b</i> has now become red hot. The volt meter
shows 25 volts of pressure, and the ammeter
shows 3 amperes of current.</p>

<p>Twenty-five volts × 3 amperes = 75 watts, which
require one tenth of a horse-power (746 watts
= 1 horse-power). The lad now takes my
place at turning the machine and finds it easy when
the switch is open, but I actually overload him by
merely closing the switch. Heating the wire red
hot requires more energy than he is able to put
forth.</p>

<p>I proposed to the president that my lecture close
at this point, and that each one in the room have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
chance to <i>feel</i> the load which was thrown upon the
dynamo each time it was required to heat the wire.
I suggested that each person should get a realizing
sense of this fact, first by doing the work himself,
and second by going home and reflecting upon this
hint. When the switch is closed three amperes of
electricity pass around the circuit. This increases
the magnetism in both the field and the armature
of the dynamo, and it requires one tenth of a horse-power
more to keep the armature moving within
the field against this magnetic pull.</p>

<p>I further desired to announce that during this
hour I had delivered to them the second key to
the Electrical Show which I had promised a few days
ago. The second key is:</p>

<p>Heat (and light) is produced by offering resistance
to the flow of the electric current. The first key
is the electro-magnet. These two unlock all the
mysteries of the show.</p>

<p>The president closed the formal exercises with
the facetious remark that I had warned them
before the lecture that they must work, so now each
would be expected to take a turn at the cranks of
the pump and dynamo.</p>

<small>APPLICATIONS OF ELECTRIC HEATING</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> programme committee decided that each
member of the Science Club should busy
himself looking for <i>applications of electric
heating</i> and should consult me freely about the
matter. My telephone was kept busy, my laboratory
was in great demand, and we were all getting
a good deal more education than the school was
giving us credit for.</p>

<p>The boys generally came to me in pairs, and each
pair having worked up some illustration of heat
produced by electricity reported it to the club.
These were spread by
the secretary in due
form upon the minutes
of the club and constituted
"The Proceedings
of the Science
Club."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_131.jpg" width="350" height="303" alt="" />
<a id="Fig69"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 69</div>
</div>

<p>1. <i>The Electric Sad
Iron</i> (<a href="#Fig69">Fig. 69</a>).&mdash;Removing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
three screws the iron comes apart, revealing a
lot of No. 24 German silver wire wound upon a
sheet of mica. This is put between other sheets
of mica (<a href="#Fig70">Fig. 70</a>) and tucked away within the body
of the iron. German silver offers about twice the
resistance of iron when it is cold, but, at the temperature
of the sad iron when in
use, there is not much difference
between the resistance
of the two metals. German
silver wire, however, does not
rust as iron wire would, and hence it is chosen.
German silver is an alloy of copper, zinc, and
nickel.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_132.jpg" width="250" height="116" alt="" />
<a id="Fig70"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 70</div>
</div>

<p>We put the 112-volt current upon this wire of
the iron, and according to the ammeter it passed
4 amperes. Its resistance must therefore have
been 28 ohms.</p>

<p>
(112 volts)/(28 ohms) = 4 amperes<br />
</p>

<p>Electricity costs us about 10 cents per kilowatt
hour. That is 10 cents for 1000 watts for an hour,
or 1 cent for a hundred watts for an hour, or, on a
100-volt current, 1 cent for an ampere for an hour.
It, therefore, costs about 4 cents or, more accurately,
4&frac12; cents an hour to heat this iron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Persons sometimes carry electric irons with them,
when they travel, to iron pocket handkerchiefs
and other small articles while stopping at a hotel.
Before connecting an iron in a chandelier one must
know the voltage used in the building. If the voltage
in use in the building is not the same as that
stamped upon the iron, it is not safe to connect it.
Not knowing this, many persons have had the
embarrassment of "blowing a fuse" and extinguishing
their own lights, and perhaps those of others
in the same building, and very likely also ruining
the iron.</p>

<p>Suppose we take for example this iron stamped
<i>110 V; 400 Watts</i>. (A slight variation of 5 or 10
volts will not injure an iron.) The wire in this
iron we found to offer about 28 ohms resistance when
hot, and it lets pass 4 amperes. This is about all
the current which it is able to carry without melting.
Now suppose a 220-volt current is used in the
building where it is proposed to connect the iron.
This would force through the wire enough current
to melt it. The wire was seen to be at a very dull-red
heat when examined in a dark room. Its temperature
was about nine hundred degrees. At this
temperature its resistance is about three times what
it is when cold. We estimated by measurements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
that the iron contained about twenty-five feet of the
wire. The boys then took twenty-five feet of No. 24
German silver wire and stretched it between two
nails driven up in the laboratory (<a href="#Fig71">Fig. 71</a>, <i>a b</i>). The
dynamo current was then sent through this. The end,
<i>c</i>, of the wire from the dynamo was provided with
a metal clip which could be slid along on the German
silver wire. Sliding this to the left, and thus shortening
the distance on the German silver wire through
which the current must pass, increased the amount
of current and heated the wire hotter. The resistance
decreases as the wire is shortened.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<a id="Fig72"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 72</div>
</div>

<p>The boys wound this wire upon a piece of asbestos
board (<a href="#Fig72">Fig. 72</a>), about nine inches
square and one eighth of an inch
thick, taking care to keep the successive
turns half an inch apart.
Asbestos paper was wrapped around
this. The two ends of the wire
were left free for connections. This
they called a "hot plate."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">

<a id="Fig73"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 73</div>
</div>

<p>2. <i>Electric Hot Plate</i> (<a href="#Fig73">Fig. 73</a>).&mdash;This when opened
was found to have wire coiled up inside in the same
manner as the sad
iron. Indeed the sad
iron supported bottom
side up makes a
perfectly good hot
plate. The particular
hot plate which we examined
had a three-point switch which gave three
different heats for the
plate. (See <a href="#Fig74">Fig. 74</a>.)
When the switch <i>S</i> is
upon the first point
the current goes
through 112 ohms of
resistance and 1 ampere
passes:</p>

<p>
(112 volts)/(112 ohms) = 1 ampere<br />
</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_135a.jpg" width="300" height="195" alt="" />
<a id="Fig74"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 74</div>
</div>

<p>This warms the plate slightly&mdash;enough
to keep food warm which has been already
cooked. This costs about one cent an
hour.</p>

<p>When the switch is placed upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
second point the current goes through 56 ohms of
resistance and 2 amperes pass.</p>

<p>
(112 volts)/(56 ohms) = 2 amperes.<br />
</p>

<p>This makes the plate warmer and is adapted to
certain cooking processes. It costs about two cents
an hour.</p>

<p>When the switch is placed upon the third point
the current goes through 28 ohms of resistance
and 4 amperes pass.</p>

<p>
(112 volts)/(28 ohms) = 4 amperes.<br />
</p>

<p>We placed upon this hot plate a basin containing
1 pint of water (equals 1 pound) and heated it from
the temperature of the room (68 degrees) to boiling
(212 degrees) in 7 minutes and then put an egg
in and boiled it 3 minutes. Using 4 amperes for
10 minutes cost two thirds of a cent. If it
takes 7 minutes to
boil a pint of water
it would require 1
hour to boil a gallon
upon this hot
plate using 4 amperes,
or 448
watts. That is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
it costs us about 4.5 cents a gallon to boil water
by electricity. The cost is usually put at three and
a half cents per gallon, but much depends upon
conditions.</p>

<p>3. <i>Traveller's Cooker</i> (<a href="#Fig75">Fig. 75</a>).&mdash;This consists of
a hot plate with a covered basin permanently
attached to it.</p>

<p>4. <i>Electric Coffee Percolator</i> (<a href="#Fig76">Fig. 76</a>) consists of
a hot plate with a
coffee percolator
to sit upon it.
The coffee percolator
might sit upon
any other hot
plate or this hot
plate might serve
any other purpose,
but people do not
seem to think of
that.</p>

<a id="Fig76"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 76</div>
</div>

<p>5. <i>Electric
Chafing-Dish</i> (<a href="#Fig77">Fig.
77</a>) consists merely of an electric hot plate with a
chafing-dish attached. The electric coffee percolators
and chafing dishes require from 300 to
600 watts according to size. If used on the 110-volt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
current they take about 3 to 6 amperes, and
if adapted to the 220-volt current they take from
1&frac12; to 3 amperes, but cost the same to operate in
either case. They have connected
with them flexible
cords and plugs to screw into
the lamp sockets.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">

<a id="Fig77"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 77</div>
</div>

<p>6. <i>Electric Broilers</i> are
merely hot plates, generally
corrugated to conduct off the
melted fat. One that we examined had a switch for
three heats: low, requiring 360 watts&mdash;costs 3.6
cents per hour; medium, requiring 600 watts&mdash;cost
6 cents per hour; high, requiring 1280 watts&mdash;cost
12.8 cents per hour.</p>

<p>7. <i>Electric Oven.</i>&mdash;This one has double walls
to retain the heat and has two large hot plates,
one on the bottom and one on the top. It is large
enough to hold four loaves of bread. It required
1520 watts for 40 minutes to heat it to the baking
temperature and one hour to bake the bread. Hence
the cost of the electricity is about 25 cents, about
what the bread would cost in the market.</p>

<p>8. <i>Electric Incubator.</i>&mdash;This is simply a well-ventilated
oven warmed by an electric hot plate
and automatically controlled so that it keeps a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
constant temperature of 103 degrees. Under these
conditions chickens hatch from hens' eggs in three
weeks. An incubator for 5 dozen eggs was found
to take 25 cents' worth of electricity for the whole
process of incubation.</p>

<p>9. <i>Electric Toaster.</i>&mdash;The wire coiled up in sad
irons and hot plates becomes hot enough to scorch
cloth and paper, and even set fire to them if they
come in direct contact. We proved this by opening
the iron and touching paper to the wire while it
was carrying the current. We also lighted a cigar
by touching it to the wire. Electric toasters have
the hot German silver wire simply covered by a
screen.</p>

<a id="Fig78"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 78</div>
</div>

<p>10. <i>Electric Cigar Lighters</i> (<a href="#Fig78">Fig. 78</a>).&mdash;The
one we examined hung by a flexible
cord from the chandelier. It had
a small disk on the side which contained
a lot of fine wire covered by
perforated mica. The wire became red
hot when the push button in the handle
was pressed. It took half an ampere
of 110-volt current, and operated only
while the button was pushed. As near as we
could calculate it cost .0003 of a cent to light a
cigar.</p>

<p>11. <i>Electric Curling Iron</i> (<a href="#Fig79">Fig. 79</a>).&mdash;One who
has flat hair needs no curling iron, but those who
have round hair may curl it temporarily, if they
will unscrew an electric light bulb and screw into
its socket the plug of an electric curling iron. The
flexible cord contains two wires insulated from each
other. One of these wires is attached to the outer
shell of the plug, the other wire is attached to the
central button of the plug. These make connections
with the two separate dynamo wires in the socket.
The current comes down one of the wires in the
flexible cord, passes through a coil of fine German
silver wire inside of the curling iron, and returns
by the other wire in the flexible cord. The small
wire in the curling iron offers 220 ohms of resistance
when hot and passes half an ampere of the 110-volt
current.</p>

<p>
(110 volts)/(220 ohms) = .5 ampere.<br />
</p>

<p>12. <i>Electric Soldering Irons</i> (<a href="#Fig80">Fig. 80</a>).&mdash;Or coppers,
as they should be called, are ideal implements for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
soldering. They remain continually at the proper
temperature and are free from corrosion. They
require from 55 to 220 watts. On the 110-volt
current they take from one half to
two amperes.</p>

<p>13. <i>Electric Heating Pad</i> (<a href="#Fig81">Fig. 81</a>).&mdash;This
consists of resistance wire inside of a
pad of soft material. It maintains a temperature
of 180 degrees, and is an excellent substitute
for a hot water bag. It contains
about two hundred and twenty ohms of
resistance and requires the same current as
a 16-candle-power lamp.</p>

<p>14. <i>Electric Fuses</i> (<a href="#Fig82">Fig. 82</a>).&mdash;Fuses are
made of short pieces of wire or thin sheet
metal. The metal is an alloy of lead and tin
which melts at a low temperature.
They derive their
name from the fact that they
readily fuse or melt. A building
is wired in various separate
circuits. The size of
the copper wires used in each
circuit is determined by the
amount of current which the
circuit is expected to carry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Each circuit is protected by one or more fuses.
These melt and cut off the current whenever too
much passes for the copper conductor to carry without
getting hot. The fuse wire melts at about
six hundred degrees, while the
copper will not melt until it
reaches nearly two thousand
degrees. This temperature
is sufficient to set fire to wood,
paper, and cloth. When any
fuse melts, the current is cut
off from all chandeliers, etc.,
in the particular circuit controlled
by the fuse. This
produces consternation among people who do not
understand the function of a fuse. They become
panic-stricken and begin to trample their neighbours
to death in the theatre or on the electric train
when they hear that a fuse is "blown" (which is
the electrician's way of saying that it has melted).
Everyone should know that a fuse is a safety device.
It is always enclosed in a box lined with sheet iron
or asbestos, so that it is impossible for the flash,
which occurs when the circuit is broken, to set fire
to anything.</p>

<p>15. <i>Electric Gas Lighter</i> (<a href="#Fig83">Fig. 83</a>).&mdash;These usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
have two or three small, dry battery cells in
the handle. By pushing a button in the handle
connection is made between this battery and a short
piece of resistance wire in the tip. This wire gets
red hot and lights the gas. It is a surprise to many
that we can light illuminating gas without bringing
a flame to it, and it is equally surprising that some
flames, or at least sparks, may not be able to light
the gas. The fact is that it is wholly a matter of
<i>temperature and kind of gas</i>. Iron heated to dull
red will not light the illuminating gas now being
furnished in New York City, while iron at a bright
red heat will do so. Iron may be hot enough to
light illuminating gas but too cool to light gasolene
vapour, which requires a dazzling white heat. Iron
which is just under the temperature at which it gives
any light may set fire to wood and paper. After
it has cooled a good deal below that, it will set fire
to sulphur, and when it has cooled so that one may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
hold it in the hand, it is still hot enough to set
fire to phosphorus. The glowing end of a lighted
cigar, the spark made by striking flint, or the spark
from a spark coil with a feeble battery, all fail to
set fire to gasolene vapour, simply because they are
not hot enough.</p>

<p>Fresh battery cells must occasionally be put in
the handle of the electric gas lighter.</p>

<p>Four facts regarding the resistance of wires it
is well to remember:</p>

<p>1. The longer the wire the more resistance it
offers to the electric current.</p>

<p>2. The smaller the diameter of the wire the more
resistance it offers.</p>

<p>3. Some materials offer more resistance than
others, for example, iron about six times as much
as copper and German silver about twelve times
as much as copper.</p>

<p>4. The common metals offer more resistance
when hot than when cold, about double the resistance
when heated to five hundred degrees. It is the
reverse with carbon, which offers more resistance
when cold than when hot. The carbon filament
lamp offers about double the resistance when cold
as when lighted to full brilliancy.</p>

<p>16. <i>Electric Flasher</i> (<a href="#Fig84">Fig. 84</a>).&mdash;For automatically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
flashing electric lights. The one which we examined
was constructed according to the plan shown in
<a href="#Fig85">Fig. 85</a>. The lighting circuit is brought to the
binding posts <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>. A
small insulated wire of
high resistance connects <i>b</i>
and <i>c</i>, being wound around the metal bar <i>a b</i>. The
resistance of this wire, when added to that of lamps,
permits not more than one fifth of an ampere to
pass, and this warms the wire slightly. The bar
<i>a b</i> is composed
of two strips of
metal, brass
above and iron
below. Heat
expands brass
more than iron. The result is that when the
current is turned on, the bar begins to curve
downward until presently it touches the metal
base of <i>c</i>. Then the full current required to light
the lamps which are in circuit passes. While the
circuit is closed through the large metal strips not
enough passes through the fine wire to warm it.
On cooling, <i>a b</i> curves upward and breaks the
connection with <i>c</i>, and now the current begins
again to warm up the small wire.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_145a.jpg" width="400" height="152" alt="" />
<a id="Fig85"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 85</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>The flasher that we examined was adapted to
operate: one 32-candle-power lamp; or two 16-candle-power
lamps; or four 8-candle-power lamps, on a one
ampere circuit of 110-volt pressure.</p>

<p>Let us see what would happen if it were connected
either with a current of higher voltage or a circuit
of more lamps. Suppose we have a 32-candle-power
carbon filament lamp in circuit. This requires
one ampere to light it. Its resistance when hot
is 110 ohms.</p>

<p>
(110 volts)/(110 ohms) = 1 ampere.<br />
</p>

<p>When cold its resistance is about double or 220 ohms.
The German silver wire of the electric flasher offers
330 ohms of resistance, and together they make
550 ohms. Thus the current is cut down to .2
ampere.</p>

<p>
(110 volts)/(330 + 220 ohms) = .2 ampere<br />
</p>

<p>Suppose now we should undertake to use the
same flasher and the same lamp on a 220-volt
current. This might push more current through
than the small wire could carry. It might melt,
or its insulation might burn off before <i>a</i> made contact
with <i>b</i>; if not the lamp would certainly burn
out after the contact. If we undertook to operate
with this flasher several 32-candle-power lamps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
instead of one upon the 110-volt circuit, the result
would be the same, for in that case the resistance
would be reduced and, therefore, a greater
current would pass than the wire could carry without
undue heating.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_147.jpg" width="600" height="83" alt="" />
<a id="Fig86"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 86</div>
</div>

<p>The boys were at first troubled to see how increasing
the number of lamps in a circuit would
decrease the resistance in that circuit. <a href="#Fig86">Fig. 86</a>
was drawn to explain the matter. The lamps
<i>l</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>l</i>, etc., are connected <i>in parallel</i>. Each lamp
makes an independent connection from one feed
wire to the other. The flasher <i>a</i> acts as a switch
to close the circuit for the whole.</p>

<p>Now if we think of these wires as pipes to conduct
water we would say that water flows from <i>D</i> to <i>E</i>
through ten pipes more readily than through one.
It would meet with only one tenth as much resistance.
The result would be the same, if we should
substitute for the ten pipes one pipe ten times as
large in cross section. So it is with wires which are
conducting electricity. Introduce two in parallel,
and you allow twice as much current to pass by
reducing the resistance to one half. Ten parallel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
conductors reduce the resistance to one tenth and
allow ten times as much current to pass.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_148.jpg" width="500" height="284" alt="" />
<a id="Fig87"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 87</div>
</div>

<p>It is to be noticed that this flasher is an automatic
switch which is opened or closed according to
temperature. Remove the fine wire from <i>a</i> and
we have precisely the device which regulated the
temperature in our electric incubator. Suppose the
"thermostat" (as it is called in that case) is placed
within the egg chamber which is to be kept at 103
degrees. A screw in the metal strip <i>c</i> underneath
the end of <i>a</i> may be set so that it will normally
touch <i>a</i>. Suppose now the brass strip is underneath
the strip of iron in <i>a</i>. As the hot plate warms
up the egg chamber, the brass will expand more
than the iron, and the bar will curve upward and
break the connection with <i>c</i>. As soon as the current
stops the temperature of the chamber begins to fall,
and the bar curves downward again until connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
is made. This device is capable of adjustment so
as to keep the temperature constantly at 103 degrees
or any other desired degree. The device is
in use for scores of different purposes, including
the regulation of temperature in school rooms.</p>

<p>17. <i>Electric Car Heaters.</i>&mdash;Ten or fifteen years
ago there were no heated street cars in New York
City. Now they are all heated by electricity and
their maximum and minimum temperatures are
regulated by law. The resistance wire may be seen
in coils underneath the car seats. Electric street
cars usually operate on a 500 or 600-volt current.
The amount of current used for heating varies from
2 to 12 amperes. Perhaps 3 amperes may be taken
as an average.</p>

<p>500 V × 3 <i>a</i> = 1500 <i>w</i> = 1&frac12; kilowatts.</p>

<p>It costs the large electric railway companies about
1.5 cents per kilowatt hour to generate their supply
of current. Eighteen hours is considered a car day.</p>

<p>1&frac12; kilowatts × 18 hours = 27 kilowatt hours.</p>

<p>27 kilowatt hours at 1.5 cents = 40 cents per
car day.</p>

<p>18. <i>Heating Apartments by Electricity.</i>&mdash;For heating
apartments by electricity the same sort of
apparatus is used as that already described for
heating cars. A family of four adults, living in
an eight-room apartment with at least 120 cubic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
feet of fresh air admitted per minute, will use on an
average ten amperes of the 110-volt current. The
cost will be about two dollars and fifty cents per
day or seventy-five dollars per month. Although
this is as much as the entire rental of a perfectly
comfortable apartment, the novelty and the convenience
attract tenants and the extra cost of rent
does not deter them.</p>

<p>19. <i>Electric Bedroom Heater.</i>&mdash;One of the boys
constructed a heater for his own room as follows:
He procured a box eight inches deep by eighteen
inches square on the
bottom. This he
lined with asbestos
paper. He then
stood it upon its
side and arranged
four incandescent
light sockets as
shown in <a href="#Fig88">Fig. 88</a>. These were connected by a flexible
cord to a plug which he could insert in place of a
lamp in the chandelier. He placed this heater on
the floor underneath the window and usually had
16-candle-power lamps in the sockets. He claimed
that it was a jolly foot warmer and kept the room
comfortable without other heat. He turned on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
from one to four lamps according to his need and
replaced the 16-candle-power lamps by 32-candle-power
lamps when the weather was extremely cold.
I remarked that he must have light along with heat
by this arrangement, and I should think that might
be objectionable when he desired to sleep at night.
He said that he always turned it off, and opened
the window at night, always preferring a cold room
to sleep in.</p>

<p>20. <i>Cooking with Incandescent Lamps.</i>&mdash;This piece
of apparatus was devised by the boys and used in my
laboratory. A sheet iron basin <i>a</i>, was inverted over
four 16-candle-power incandescent lamps, shown
in elevation by <a href="#Fig89">Fig. 89</a>, and shown in plan by <a href="#Fig90">Fig.
90</a>. The sides of the basin were cut so as to admit
the glass globes of the lamps, but the sockets and
keys were outside, so that it was convenient to turn
on and off the lamps separately, thus using one half
to two amperes of current, as desired. This rested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
upon another basin, <i>b</i>. Basin <i>b</i> was covered with
asbestos for the lamps to lie on and the whole was
attached to a board base, <i>c</i>. A flexible cord and
plug allowed us to attach this to the chandelier.
A pint of water was boiled upon this stove in fifteen
minutes, and refreshments have been served hot
from it repeatedly.</p>

<p>21. <i>Electric Fireless Cooker.</i>&mdash;There are five indictments
against ordinary cooking processes.</p>

<p>1. They heat the house in summer.</p>

<p>2. They convert what would be pleasant
flavours in the food into noxious odours about
the house.</p>

<p>3. They cannot be controlled with regard to
time and temperature as scientific experiments
should be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>4. They confine the cook too closely and are
not sufficiently automatic.</p>

<p>5. They are wasteful of fuel.</p>

<p>It would seem that electricity might enable us
to cure most of these evils. To be sure the production
of heat by electricity is wasteful of fuel, and
it seems doubtful how the account will balance
regarding the fifth item. But the remaining four
items furnish a very hopeful field for research.
I use the last word advisedly, and think it is just
as applicable to high school boys as to university
students. After experimenting awhile the boys and
I concluded to give a dinner party in the laboratory
and invite a few friends to test the results
of our cooking.</p>

<p>We procured a cylinder of magnesia such as is
used for covering large steam-pipes. This was
inverted over our electric stove which was illustrated
in <a href="#Fig89">Fig. 89</a>. The magnesia was cut at the bottom,
so as to give access to the key sockets of the lamps,
(<a href="#Fig91">Fig. 91</a>). First upon the electric stove was placed
a covered dish containing a roast of lamb. Above
this was another dish containing a vegetable, and
upon the top of that was a pudding. A flat piece
of magnesia was used as a cover to the whole.
Through a hole in this was suspended a thermometer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_154.jpg" width="500" height="629" alt="" />
<a id="Fig91"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 91</div>
</div>

<p>This "fireless cooker" was sitting in the centre
of the dinner table when the guests gathered around
it. We had these problems for investigation:</p>

<p>1. Will this cooker heat the house in summer?</p>

<p>All testified that they did not know that there
was any heat about it until they laid their hands
upon it, and then they found it only very slightly
warm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Is there any smell of cooking here? The
process has been carried on from start to finish right
on this table.</p>

<p>All agreed that no smell could be detected.</p>

<p>I then turned off the electric current which had
been running until now and served the meat and
vegetable, leaving the pudding inside to be kept
warm by the hot walls of the cooker.</p>

<p>3. Regarding the control of the process: we
were using 32-candle-power lamps, which gave us
a variable current, from 0 to 4 amperes, and a watch
and a thermometer. We had control, but as yet
lacked knowledge of how it should be used. In the
present case we had arbitrarily decided to begin with
temperature of 400 degrees, continue it for 20
minutes, then turn off all the electric current, and
let the temperature fall gradually. This had been
done at our convenience in the morning before
school. At a quarter before twelve we had found
the temperature at 200 degrees, and turned on all
the current, and now, at five minutes past twelve
o'clock, all testified that the lamb was particularly
good&mdash;neither too well done nor undercooked, and
that its flavour was better than usual.</p>

<p>As for economy of fuel, we find at least that we
get better results from incandescent lamps than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
from hot plates used in the same apparatus, and the
electric equipment enables us to put the heat exactly
where it is needed and nowhere else.</p>

<p>22. <i>Incandescent Lamp.</i>&mdash;We feel quite justified
in putting the incandescent lamp under the heading,
<i>Applications of Electric Heating</i>, since the electric
lamps in general use convert 96 per cent. of the
electric energy into heat and only 4 per cent. into
light.</p>

<p>They were originally made by introducing a short
piece of fine wire into the circuit, choosing the kind
of wire, its diameter, and its length so as to make
the proper relation between resistance and voltage,
in order that enough current might pass to make it
white hot, but not quite melt it. Platinum wire was
first chosen because it would stand the highest
heat without melting and without rusting.</p>

<p>We will pass our 112-volt current through 9 feet
of the No. 24 iron wire. The wire is heated to bright
red, but does not melt as it did when we used 8
feet in a former experiment. The increased length
has added resistance, and, as you see by the ammeter,
cut the current down from 8 to 7.5 amperes.
I will now darken the room and you find that it is
giving light enough to read by. But you notice that
the light is growing dimmer, its colour is growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
redder, and the ammeter indicates that less current
is passing. I will cut off the current and let you
examine the wire and you notice that a crust has
formed upon it. This is due to the oxygen of the
air which unites with the iron, forming iron rust.
Iron rust does not conduct electricity. We have
converted No. 24 iron wire into a wire of smaller
diameter with a sheath of iron rust around it. We
might prevent the rusting by putting the wire in a
glass globe and exhausting the air from it.</p>

<p>I have here a piece of No. 24 platinum wire which
has about the same resistance as iron wire when
cold, but you notice that I may use a very much
shorter length than I did of the iron wire because
it will endure a very much higher heat without
melting. Reducing the length would reduce the
resistance, but reducing the resistance would allow
more current to pass. If more current should pass
it would make the wire hotter, and raising the
temperature would increase the resistance, which
would cut down the current, etc. By sliding the
clip <i>c</i> (<a href="#Fig92">Fig. 92</a>), along, I finally reach a point where
conditions balance so that I get a very brilliant
light, dangerously near the fusing point of the
platinum which is three thousand degrees above the
boiling point of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1879 Mr. Thomas A. Edison literally searched
the whole world for something better than platinum
for the filament of an incandescent lamp. He
finally decided upon charred threads of a bamboo
which he found in Japan. No research was ever
more timely than this. Whereas there was practically
no electric lighting before 1880, soon after that
there began a phenomenal demand for carbon filament
lamps. In 1890, 800,000 of these
lamps were manufactured in the United
States. In 1900 the number had risen
to 25,000,000. In 1909 central stations
were supplying electric current to
41,807,944 incandescent electric lights.
By far the greatest number are still
made with carbon filaments.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</div>

<p>We examined an ordinary 110-volt 16-candle-power
carbon filament lamp, (<a href="#Fig93">Fig. 93</a>). As near as
we could estimate, its filament measured about
eight inches in length. We broke open the bulb of
this lamp by laying it upon the table and tapping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
it with a board. The bulb broke with rather a
loud noise and the brittle carbon filament broke
into many pieces. We found one of these pieces and
measured its diameter with a wire gauge, (<a href="#Fig94">Fig. 94</a>).
It was the same size as
No. 33 wire, which we also
found by the wire gauge
was the size of No. 90
sewing cotton. The diameter of No. 33 wire
was given upon the wire gauge as .007
inch. When lighted, the filament of this lamp
had looked to be about the size of No. 18 wire,
which has a diameter of .04. That is, the
filament when lighted looked six times as thick
as it really was. Those who use sewing cotton
learn quickly to know the size of the thread
by its number. So those who have much to do
with wire easily learn the system of designating
sizes by numbers. Here are some selected
figures easy to remember. A trolley wire is
about one third of an inch in diameter. It is
designated as No. 0. Notice in the following
table that as the numbers rise by six the
diameters are divided by two. Notice also that
as the diameters diminish by two the resistance
increases by four.</p>

<p>10,560 feet equal two miles.</p>

<p>Number 36 is the wire used upon the spools of
telegraph receivers. They offer 75 ohms of resistance
and therefore contain 30 feet of wire
(30 × 2.5 = 75). These resistances are for ordinary
school room temperatures.</p>

<p>These figures are not exact, but useful.</p>

<p>We procured a string of eight small lamps (<a href="#Fig95">Fig.
95</a>), such as are used in lighting Christmas trees.
Each was marked 14 volt, 2-candle-power. The
carbon filament of each
was about one inch
long and apparently
the same diameter as
that of the 16-candle-power
lamp. When
the 110-volt current
was sent through the
group of eight connected in series they seemed to give about the same
light as the single 16-candle-power lamp. It is as
though the filament of the 16-candle-power lamp had
been cut into eight pieces, and distributed through
eight small lamps. We introduced an ammeter into
the circuit and found that half an ampere of electricity
passed through the single 16-candle-power lamp&mdash;and
half an ampere likewise passed through the group
of eight 2-candle-power lamps.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_161.jpg" width="350" height="286" alt="" />
<a id="Fig95"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 95</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>The 110-volt current can push an ampere of
electricity through eight inches of carbon thread
seven thousandths of an inch in diameter, and
when this happens the filament gets hot enough
to give out as much light as sixteen standard candles.
In the place of the 16-candle-power lamp, we put a
32-candle-power 110-volt lamp. The ammeter indicated
one ampere. The carbon filament was larger
(No. 30, diameter = .01 inch), so as to allow more
current to pass. An 8-candle-power 110-volt lamp
was substituted; one quarter of an ampere passed.
A 4-candle-power 110-volt lamp was used; one eighth
of an ampere passed. A 100-candle-power 110-volt
lamp was substituted; three amperes of current
passed through it. In all these cases the lamps
which passed the larger current had the larger
filaments. A little practice would enable one to
distinguish between these lamps without labels
by examining their filaments. Among these 110-volt
lamps, it is to be noted that the amount of
light which they give is proportional to the amount
of current which they pass. And it is convenient
to remember that one ampere of electricity for
one hour costs about one cent.</p>

<p>We introduced into the socket a "Hylo" lamp
(<a href="#Fig96">Fig. 96</a>). The filament, <i>A</i>, took half an ampere of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
electricity, gave 16-candle-power of light, and cost
half a cent an hour. When the lamp was turned
in its socket the current was switched off of the
filament <i>A</i>, and on to the filament <i>a</i>. This took
.03 of an ampere, gave one candle-power of light,
and cost .03 of a cent an hour,
or at the rate of about $3.00 a
year, burning continuously day
and night.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_163.jpg" width="250" height="382" alt="" />
<a id="Fig96"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 96</div>
</div>

<p>The uses of such a lamp are
apparent in rooms which have no
daylight. However, a wall switch
at the entrance of such a room,
making it easy to throw on and
off the light entirely, seems to be a
more satisfactory arrangement. One of the boys
connected a wattmeter in the circuit with a hylo
lamp and found that the small filament did not
pass current enough to move the armature of the
wattmeter. Hence that may be burned alone without
affecting the consumer's bills.</p>

<p>We took a 16-candle-power 220-volt lamp, and
lighted it by a 220-volt current. The meter showed
that it allowed only one quarter of an ampere to
pass. The filament was very much smaller than
that in the 110-volt, 16-candle-power lamp. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
pressure was twice as great as before, but the resistance
was four times as great, and hence only
half as much current passed. We find that it costs
just as much to generate one quarter of an ampere
at 220-volt pressure as it does to generate half an
ampere at 110-volt pressure.</p>

<p>We must, of course, pay for electricity according
to the cost of producing it. To produce .5 ampere
at 110-volt pressure costs the same as one
ampere at 55-volt pressure, or .25 amperes at 220
volts. It will be noticed that the products of the
two factors in each case are the same. The product
of an ampere multiplied by a volt is a watt. In
each of the above three cases the amount of electrical
energy is 55 watts. This will produce a
definite quantity of light&mdash;about 16 candle-power
when the carbon filament is used, and this quantity
does not vary as either volts or amperes, but
as the product of these, namely, watts.</p>

<p>Each of these lamps is called a 55-watt lamp,
and, since they each give 16 candle-power of light,
a carbon filament lamp gives one candle-power of
light for three and a half watts of electricity. Electricity
for lighting purposes usually costs <i>10
cents per kilowatt hour</i>, that is, 10 cents for 1000
watts for one hour, or one cent for 100 watts for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
one hour. Hence a 55-watt lamp costs a trifle more
than half a cent for one hour, or exactly .55 cents,
and a 32-candle-power lamp costs 1.1 cents per hour.</p>

<p>We introduced into the socket a 48-candle-power
110-volt tungsten lamp (<a href="#Fig97">Fig. 97</a>), and turned on the
110-volt current. The ammeter showed 55 ampere.
Hence the lamp is a 60-watt
lamp, and requires one and a
quarter watts per candle-power.
That is, the metal tungsten
is nearly three times as efficient
as carbon for producing light
from electricity.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">

</div>

<p>With pincers we broke off the
tip of a 32-candle-power carbon
filament lamp, making a small
hole in the large end of the bulb.
The air rushed in. We then
put the lamp in the socket and turned on
the current. The carbon filament glowed as usual,
and slowly burned up, growing smaller as it did so.
The ammeter which was in circuit showed that the
current, which was one ampere at the beginning,
grew steadily less as the filament grew smaller,
until finally when it was about one quarter of an
ampere, the circuit was broken by the filament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
burning in two. We removed the lamp from the
socket and with a dropper tube introduced a little
lime water, and shook it to absorb any gas which
might have been formed in there. It became
milky white, as it always does when introduced
where carbon has been burned. This would be
a sufficient proof that the filament was made of
carbon, if we did not already know it. The air is
exhausted from these bulbs to prevent the carbon
filament from burning up.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_167.jpg" width="250" height="237" alt="" />
<a id="Fig98"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 98</div>
</div>

<p>The carbon filament lamps were, as has been
said, the invention of Mr. Thomas A. Edison in
1879. Such a statement must, however, be qualified
by the assertion that this, like nearly all invention,
was but the consummation of a long line
of researches made by many men for many
years. The early filaments were made of bamboo
thread, charred, but now they are drawn like
spider's web out of a sticky liquid and carbonized
at a high temperature. They are attached in
the lamp to short pieces of platinum wire which
are sealed through the glass walls of the bulb. One
wire connects with the brass collar of the bulb, and
the other with the central piece of brass at the
base of the bulb. We dissected a socket and found
that when the lamp is placed in the socket, the collar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
of the lamp is screwed into the collar of the socket,
and the base of the lamp comes in contact with a
brass spring in the bottom of the socket (<a href="#Fig98">Fig. 98</a>).
The spring is connected with one copper wire bringing
electricity from the dynamo. The collar is
connected with the other wire
from the dynamo. This connection
is made and broken
by turning the key of the
socket. The wires are made of
copper since copper is a particularly
good conductor of electricity.
No electricity can flow
unless this circuit is complete. Socket keys and wall
switches make or close gaps in this circuit. No copper
wires for carrying electric-lighting current are
smaller than No. 12, which has a diameter of .08
or about one twelfth of an inch. The intention is to
have as little resistance to the current as possible,
except in the filament of the lamp itself. There resistance
is purposely introduced in order to convert electricity
into light, light without heat if that were possible,
but since that has not yet been found possible,
heat for the sake of the accompanying light. Unhappily
only 4 per cent. of the electrical energy goes into
light and 96 per cent. goes into useless, or even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
harmful, heat. The tungsten lamps, which are now
coming into use, are nearly three times as efficient
in the production of light as are the carbon filament
lamps. The dynamo exerts its entire pressure
upon the lamp and furnishes current as follows:</p>

<p>A dynamo of 110-volt pressure gives:</p>

<p>1 ampere = 110 watts, through a 32-candle-power
lamp, cost one cent an hour, or</p>

<p>.5 ampere = 55 watts, through a 16-candle-power
lamp, cost half a cent an hour, or</p>

<p>.25 ampere = 27&frac12; watts, through an 8-candle-power
lamp, cost a quarter of a cent an hour.</p>

<p>A dynamo of 220-volt pressure gives:</p>

<p>.5 ampere = 110 watts, through a 32-candle-power
lamp, cost one cent an hour, or</p>

<p>.25 ampere = 55 watts, through a 16-candle-power
lamp, cost half a cent an hour, or</p>

<p>.125 ampere = 27&frac12; watts, through an 8-candle-power
lamp, cost a quarter of a cent an hour.</p>

<p>The carbon filament lamps, barring accidents,
have a natural life varying from 600 to 1000 hours
of actual incandescence. At the end of that period
the filament has become so thin that it will fall
apart by ordinary usage. It is never profitable,
however, to use them for their whole lifetime.
The lamp gradually volatilizes carbon and deposits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
it upon the inner walls of the bulb, producing a
smoky appearance and shutting off light. As the
filament grows thinner by this process, it offers
greater resistance to the current, and as the amount
of current grows less the proportion of light to
current grows rapidly less, so that at last instead
of paying for 3.5 watts of electricity per candle-power
of light one must pay for perhaps seven or
eight watts per candle-power. We pay fifteen cents
apiece for 16-candle-power lamps, and it is economy
to renew them about twice a year, if they are burned,
say three hours a day, or a little over five hundred
hours. It is interesting to note that when a direct
current is used the evaporation from the carbon filament
always takes place at the negative end alone,
that is, the end from which the current is leaving
the lamp. If an alternating current is used the
evaporation goes on from all parts of the filament
alike. This is a case of evaporation from the solid
state. Carbon does not boil below 6,000 degrees,
and the filament reaches about 2,450 degrees.</p>

<p>Tantalum, tungsten, and osmium lamps have
metal filaments. These metals are better conductors
than carbon but unlike carbon their resistance
increases as their temperature rises, and their
special virtue is that they are capable of enduring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
an extremely high temperature without melting.
The wire used in some of these filaments is as small
as .002 of an inch, or No. 44. In order to furnish
sufficient resistance to prevent the 110-volt current
from melting, they often have a length exceeding
two feet. This is laced back and forth within the
small bulb. At the temperature of bright incandescence
their resistance may be increased as much
as fivefold and sometimes becomes about ten ohms
to the inch. Like all metals they are more brittle
when cold than hot. Hence when cleaning such
lamps it is advisable to turn on the current to avoid
breaking the filament by jarring. Filaments which
are too fragile to endure the jar of ordinary railway
travel, when cold, have gone through railway wrecks
safely when lighted.</p>

<p>It is a general rule that good conductors of electricity
grow more resistant as the temperature rises
while non-conductors resist less as the temperature
rises. Hence the insulating material which is used
to cover copper wires fails to protect if highly heated.</p>

<p>If a 110-volt lamp is put into a 220-volt circuit,
one might expect that the lamp would burn out
without doing further damage to the circuit, but
this is not the case. As the filament approaches
its melting point, 6000 degrees, it becomes so good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
a conductor that it carries current enough to melt
a fifteen ampere fuse. It is, therefore, the fuse
that protects the circuit and not the burning out
of the lamp. The bulb containing the highly heated
carbon vapour would conduct the current as an
arc lamp does.</p>

<p>23. <i>Arc Lamp.</i>&mdash;We
fastened two
electric light carbons
to the ends of copper
wires connected
for the 110-volt current.
A rheostat,
<i>R</i> (<a href="#Fig99">Fig. 99</a>), in circuit,
was set at 6.5
ohms. One lower
carbon was fastened into a clamp, and the other
was touched to it, and then drawn away about
three-eighths of an inch. A very brilliant light was
produced. Probably about 1800 candle-power.
The ammeter <i>A</i> showed 10 amperes, and the volt meter
<i>V</i> showed 45 volts. 45 volts × 10 amperes =
450 watts, 1800 candle-power, 25 watts per candle-power.</p>

<p>The arc light is the cheapest of all lights but is
too dazzlingly bright for household purposes. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
is used for outdoor lighting chiefly, and particularly
for large search-lights. The temperature is over
6000 degrees, which boils the carbon and fills the
gap between the two pencils with a stream of carbon
vapour. This conducts the current like the filament
in an incandescent lamp. The air gap between
the carbon pencils would have a resistance of many
thousand ohms if it were not for the presence of the
carbon vapour. The hot carbon vapour reduces
the resistance of this space to 4.5 ohms.</p>

<p>
(45 volts)/(4.5 ohms) = 10 amperes.<br />
</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>
(110 volts)/(6.5 + 4.5 ohms) = 10 amperes.<br />
</p>

<p>The carbon pencils account for part of this resistance&mdash;not
more than a third of an ohm
however.</p>

<p>It is evident that arc lamps in use must have an
automatic mechanism which shall permit the carbons
to touch whenever the current is not passing,
but which shall draw them apart to the proper
distance after the carbon vapour has been formed,
or, as we say, after the arc has been established.
This mechanism is nothing else than electro-magnets
which are operated by the lighting circuit
itself. It may require thoughtful examination to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
recognize these as electro-magnets, in every case,
but that is what they are. Sometimes they are
coils of wire, which do not have iron cores and armatures
separate to be sure&mdash;but nevertheless
they have both of these united in one movable
rod, and they produce magnetic fields.</p>

<p>Suppose I pass
an electric current
around this coil <i>A</i>
(<a href="#Fig100">Fig. 100</a>). The region
about the coil
becomes a magnetic
field with its north
pole situated at a
point in space, say
<i>N</i>. The influence of this field causes the iron
rod to become a magnet with its south pole
uppermost, and if the current is strong enough,
and the field which it produces is strong enough,
it will lift the iron rod up into the coil. By
varying the strength of the current you see
I may make this rod dance up and down in space
touching nothing&mdash;a veritable ghost dance.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_173.jpg" width="350" height="273" alt="" />
<a id="Fig100"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 100</div>
</div>

<p>It may be pettifogging to say that the upper portion
of this iron rod is the core of the magnetic
field, and its lower portion is the armature. Yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
this is right, and pettifogging may be right when it
is the only way to bring out the fact.</p>

<p>Our great study now is to produce light without
heat, or at least to come as near to it as the firefly
does. The firefly gives 98 per cent. light and two
per cent. heat. The arc lamp gives 12 per cent. light
and 88 per cent. heat. The carbon filament gives
4 per cent. light and 96 per cent. heat. When we have
made considerable progress in that direction we shall
take electric lamps out of the chapter on electric heating
and form a new chapter on electric lighting.</p>

<p>One might expect that a rod made of carbon
would quickly burn up, particularly when raised
to the exceeding high temperature of the electric
arc. While it is true that carbon in the form of
charcoal burns so readily that it is used instead of
kindlings for lighting a fire, carbon in the form of
graphite in our so-called "lead" pencils and carbon
as it is prepared for electric light pencils burns only
very slowly even at exceedingly high temperatures.
The carbon rods used in arc lamps endure a temperature
of over 6000 degrees, without losing more than
one inch an hour, and half of that is simply volatilized&mdash;not
burned.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting improvements ever
made in the arc light is that of enclosing the arc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
in an inner glass globe. This globe is closed airtight
below with a small opening above. When
the arc is formed the oxygen of the air in the inner
globe is soon consumed and then combustion is
no longer possible. We illustrated this by an
experiment. An ordinary cork was chosen to fit
the large end of an argand lamp chimney and through
a hole in this was passed one of the carbon rods
(<a href="#Fig101">Fig. 101</a>). A metal clamp made connections between
this carbon and the negative wire from the
dynamo. The other carbon, attached
by a clamp to the positive wire, was
thrust down into the upper end of
the chimney until it touched the
negative carbon, and then drawn
upward a short distance, drawing an
arc, as we say. This soon makes
an atmosphere within the chimney
where combustion cannot go on for
want of oxygen. The arc, however,
continues to glow as in the open air,
and the carbons may be drawn further
apart than in the open air
without breaking the arc, hence more of the external
resistance may be cut out and a higher voltage
put upon the lamp.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_175.jpg" width="200" height="441" alt="" />
<a id="Fig101"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 101</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Carbons which burn out in a single night if used
in open arc lamps last two weeks in enclosed arc
lamps.</p>

<p>The lower carbon, when removed from the lamp
chimney of the last experiment, served as a lead
pencil to write on paper. The positive carbon
would not make a mark on paper. In all arc lamps
carbon is distilled from the positive pencil, condensing
upon the negative pencil as graphite, which is
the material used in making "lead" pencils. They
are called "lead" pencils because they were originally
made of lead, but now they are made of graphite
which is mined from the earth.</p>

<p>As soon as the arc is broken it becomes evident
that the positive carbon has been heated much the
hotter of the two, a fact that could not be detected
while it was lighted because of the dazzling brightness
of the arc. The negative carbon turns black almost
immediately, while the positive carbon remains at a
bright red heat for some time.</p>

<p>This fact needs to be borne in mind when adjusting
arc light carbons in search-lights, stereopticons,
and all like apparatus in which the light must be
placed at the focus of a lens. That is, it is necessary
to know from what point the light really comes
and it is necessary to have some adjusting device<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
to keep this point continually at the focus of
the lens.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">

<p>24. <i>Search-Light.</i>&mdash;(<a href="#Fig102">Fig. 102</a>). This is simply an
arc lamp with reflectors behind it and lenses in
front of it. The whole apparatus
is pivoted so as to be easily made
to shine in any direction. The
function of the lenses and the
reflectors is to collect stray rays of
light and send them all out in the
same direction. This is shown in
<a href="#Fig103">Fig. 103</a> where for simplicity the
lens is represented as a single piece.
<i>L</i> represents a point of light which
will naturally send its rays out in all
directions as the radii of a sphere;
<i>m</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>m</i> represents a bright reflecting
surface which is given that peculiar
curve called a parabola. It has the
unique faculty of reflecting in a parallel direction all
the rays which may fall upon it from <i>L</i>, so long as <i>L</i> is
kept at that particular point called the focus, <i>a b</i> is a
lens of glass which has that peculiar curve that
enables it to bend all rays which fall upon it from <i>L</i>,
so that they may pass out parallel.</p>

<p>25. <i>Stereopticon.</i>&mdash;This also has the necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
devices to gather the rays of the arc lamp and send
them forth parallel, and in addition it has a series
of lenses which produce upon a distant screen an
enlarged picture of any transparent object held
in these parallel rays.</p>

<p>26. <i>Burglar's Flash-Light.</i>&mdash;There are many forms
of this. The one we examined is represented in
<a href="#Fig104">Fig. 104</a>. We unscrewed a metal ring at the left-hand
end and found, first a glass lens and behind
that a miniature
electric light, requiring
three volts and
half an ampere. We
knew, therefore, that it must be supplied with two
cells, since one cell may give not more than 1.5 volts.
We also knew that it would only be used to <i>flash</i> a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
light, since if dry cells are required to furnish half an
ampere continuously they soon run down. Behind
the lamp there was a bright metal reflector&mdash;the lens
and reflector are fairly well represented in <a href="#Fig103">Fig. 103</a>.
The filament of the lamp is connected with two
small battery cells in the handle. These may be
removed and replaced by new ones by unscrewing a
cap at the right-hand end. The circuit is closed by
a metal spring on the side of the tube, which acts
as a push button. It is situated where it may be
conveniently pressed by the thumb. The small
batteries necessarily have a short life and must be
replaced quite frequently. Being a special thing
they cost nearly twice what the regular dry cell does.</p>

<p>27. <i>Mercury Vapour
Lamp.</i>&mdash;This is an interesting
variety of arc
light in which the vapour
of mercury takes the
place of the vapour of carbon. <i>G</i>, in <a href="#Fig105">Fig.
105</a>, represents a glass tube from which the
air has been exhausted. The wires of the lighting
circuit are fused into the ends of the tube.
At one end, and in contact with one of these wires, is a
small pool of mercury. By pulling the cord <i>c</i>
the tube is tilted on the pivot <i>p</i>, so that a stream of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
mercury flows along the whole length of the tube
and closes the electric circuit. When the tube
falls back into its normal position, as represented
in the figure, the electric arc persists upon the
mercury vapour. Incandescent mercury vapour
gives light strong in green, blue, and violet, but
deficient in red and yellow. It, therefore, gives
nothing its natural appearance but casts a ghastly
hue over everything.</p>

<p>This lamp was invented in 1902, by Peter Cooper-Hewitt,
grandson of the founder of Cooper Union
in New York City.</p>

<p>It gives a very suitable light for making photographic
prints, and is much used for that. This
lamp operates upon the 110-volt circuit. It is the
longest step yet taken toward getting light without
heat, but perhaps shows what we must expect
when we reach that goal, namely, unsatisfactory
colour values in the light. Probably such is the
case with the firefly.</p>

<p>28. <i>The Moore Light.</i>&mdash;In 1896 Prof. D. McFarland
Moore brought out his vacuum tube light
(<a href="#Fig106">Fig. 106</a>). We visited an ordinary dry goods store
which had been equipped with this. Glass tubing
is put together very much as one would put up a
stove pipe or a job of plumbing. The joints are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
fused and made air-tight by playing a flame upon
them after the pipe is up in place. This pipe is
led around into all nooks and corners where there
would be dark places.
The air is pumped out
of this tube and a trifling
amount of some vapour
is introduced, the kind
varying according to the
tint of colour which is
desired.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_181.jpg" width="350" height="306" alt="" />
<a id="Fig106"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 106</div>
</div>

<p>Metal terminals are
fused into the ends of this tube. The tube we saw
was seventy-five feet long. A 1000-volt alternating
current is applied to the terminals and the
vapour becomes incandescent, filling the whole
tube full of light. The first thing that the boys
remarked was that although the room was brilliantly
lighted no object cast a shadow. It seemed as
though light was everywhere and there was no
chance to screen it off.</p>

<p>29. <i>The Nernst Lamp.</i>&mdash;In 1897 the Nernst
lamp appeared in Germany. It is a good illustration
of an insulating substance becoming a conductor
when heated to a high temperature. The "glower,"
as it is called, is composed of one or several short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
rods of clay-like material. This is first heated by
sending the electric current through resistance wire
placed directly underneath it and connected in
shunt with it. When it gets hot, current begins
to pass through it, and is automatically cut off
from the resistance coil. The glower produces
an intensely bright and white light although it
does not itself exceed the temperature of 1742
degrees.</p>

<p>Electric installations are now so carefully constructed
that fires from poor insulation are very
rare. Less than one fire in three hundred appears
to be traceable to that cause.</p>

<p>30. <i>Electric Welding.</i>&mdash;Nothing is more common
in electrical matters than heat produced by poor
contacts. In this laboratory are two chandeliers,
each controlled by a wall switch. After the current
has been on the chandeliers for half an hour you will
always find one of those wall switches warm, while
the other is not perceptibly warmer than other
objects in the room. The explanation is that there
is poor contact in one of them. When two metal
conductors touch one another at a mere point the
electric current, in passing from one of these conductors
to the other across such a narrow bridge,
meets resistance and develops heat&mdash;sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
heat enough to fuse the point, and either break the
contact, or, what is more likely, start a minute arc
at that point. In some cases this makes the apparatus
dangerously hot, and in other cases it bridges
the gap with a broader and better contact&mdash;a true
electric weld. Electric welding is applied to everything,
from chicken fence to railway rails. Enormously
large currents are used for the purpose,
in some cases as high as 50,000 amperes being employed.
The rails of railroads are welded end to
end by a current of several thousand amperes sent
through the joint by perhaps two or three volts.
The joint heats and fuses together merely because
the poor contact offers resistance to this enormous
current.</p>

<h2><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX<br /><br />
<small>LIGHTING A SUMMER CAMP BY ELECTRICITY</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Summer</span> had arrived. The Science Club had
held its last meeting for the season. Harold
had engaged three other boys to spend the
summer at the farm. I had the roof of an old mill
reshingled and gave it to them for a camp. They
were to make it over inside. I sent the boys to the
country as early as it was possible for them to get
away. It would be six weeks later before I could
follow them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_185.jpg" width="600" height="339" alt="" />
<a id="Fig107"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 107</div>
</div>

<p>When I did arrive I found they had elaborate
schemes indeed. The first floor of the mill had been
partitioned off into rooms, as shown in diagram
(<a href="#Fig107">Fig. 107</a>), <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> being bedrooms; <i>e</i> was a
wash room, the like of which has never been seen
before. It had not occurred to me that the mill
pond <i>m</i>, which came to the very corner of the building,
would furnish the boys a complete system of
city water-works. At <i>g</i>, in the corner of this room,
they had cut a hole in the floor and nailed slats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
across upon the under side of the timbers,
making a depressed floor for a shower bath. This
was directly over a stream of water which issued
from the mill pond. Hanging from the ceiling over
this spot was the nozzle of a garden hose. The
other end of this hose ran into the mill pond. The
nozzle was capable of delivering
either a stream or a
shower, according to which
way it was twisted in its
socket. It was also capable
of shutting off entirely the
flow of water. The boys
asked me to hold my hand in
the shower, and to my astonishment
it was warm. "What,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
pray, is your heating system?" I inquired. They
invited me to go and see. Moored outside in the mill
pond at the corner of the building was our motor
boat, which the boys were allowed to use freely
and which they understood as well as any one.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_185a.jpg" width="250" height="342" alt="" />
<a id="Fig108"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 108</div>
</div>

<p>They said that ordinarily they used for the shower
the cool water of the lake, which they much preferred,
and which ran of its own accord, the lake being a
trifle higher than the nozzle of the shower, but knowing
my antipathy for the cold bath they had slipped
the end of the rubber hose over the outlet pipe of
the pump which served to cool the gasolene engine
in the boat. The engine uncoupled from the propeller
was heating and pumping water for my shower
bath, and I immediately accepted the invitation to
enjoy it.</p>

<p>Certainly no bath was ever more delightful than
that one, coming, as it did, at the close of a hot, dirty
ride from the city.</p>

<p>I had hastened the bath, because it was already
dusk and I had no candle at the mill, but suddenly
the room lighted up as if by magic. I saw then
what had before escaped my notice, a miniature electric
lamp, six-volt, two-candle-power, tungsten, such
as are used for tail lights on automobiles. Since
tungsten requires about 1.25 watts per candle-power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
it was a 2.5-watts lamp, and since it was adapted to
six volts it would take about four tenths of an
ampere.</p>

<p>6 volts × .4 ampere = 2.4 watts. The little wire
filament looked to be about 1.5 inches long. Its
resistance must have been 15 ohms.</p>

<p>6 volts/15 ohms = .4 ampere.</p>

<p>A battery of five cells was used to furnish electric
current for the lamp. Lamps were installed in the
bedrooms also and were not intended to be used
more than half an hour at a time. Dry battery
cells are excellent for this purpose, and for so small
a current the cheapest dry cells are as good as the
more expensive ones. These cost fifteen cents a
cell. They were connected by short pieces of bare
copper wire; No. 18 "in series," as shown in
<a href="#Fig109">Fig. 109</a>. A wire ran from the central (carbon)
binding post of one cell to the marginal (zinc)
binding post of the next cell. This battery was
placed on a shelf in a convenient place. A bare
copper wire, No. 18, was attached to the carbon
post at one end of the battery and another to the
zinc post at the other end of the battery, and these
two wires ran to all the rooms where lamps were
placed. The wires were fastened up on the walls
by staples, taking care that they should nowhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
come in contact with each other and "short circuit"
the battery. Whenever it was necessary for one
wire to cross another, small pieces of pasteboard
were tacked up to prevent their touching each other.
The lamps <i>L</i> (<a href="#Fig109">Fig. 109</a>) were connected to these wires
"in parallel." They cost forty cents apiece, and
the miniature sockets, into which they were screwed,
cost five cents each. One of these sockets was
screwed to the side of the door casing in each bedroom.
Wires were attached to the line wires, simply
by twisting them together. One of these came
down to one side of the socket and the other came
to the other side of the socket through a switch, <i>s</i>,
made of a strip of sheet zinc. The cost of the entire
installation was as follows:</p>

<p>This amount of electrical energy would cost six
cents if generated by a dynamo. It is generally
stated that electricity costs fifty times as much if
generated by battery as by dynamo. In this case
the battery actually did serve for the whole season
of 100 days and was not exhausted at the end of
the season.</p>

<p>Indeed, since that season, the boys have found
that battery cells which had been too much exhausted
for use on the engine served very well on the
lamps. By use the cells lose, not much in voltage,
but in the ability to furnish sufficient quantity in
amperes to make the hot spark required for igniting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
the mixture of gasolene and air in an engine cylinder.
When they have been discarded for use with the
engine they may still furnish the small amount of
current required for the lamps&mdash;provided not too
many lamps are used at one time.</p>

<p>The dynamo current is always surprisingly cheap
when compared with that produced by a battery,
but, on the other hand, we are never as economical
in the use of the dynamo current as we are with that
of the battery.</p>

<p>If all five of the lamps in the above equipment
were lighted at the same time and kept burning for
half an hour, the battery would run down rather
badly and would not fully recover. But if one only
is used at a time and for not more than thirty
minutes, or if more than one is used at a time and
for a proportionately shorter period, the battery
will receive no damage.</p>

<p>Dry battery cells may be purchased for either
twenty-five cents or fifteen cents each. The chief
difference is that the former are capable of giving
larger current than the latter, when working against
very small resistance. For example, the former may
give twenty to twenty-five amperes on a short
circuit, that is, connected directly with the ammeter
without other resistance, while the latter may give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
not more than six to ten amperes under similar conditions.
For most purposes, other than igniting
gasolene engines, in which dry cells are used, an
exceedingly small current is required. The electric
bell, for example, may not require more than .2 of
an ampere and that intermittently. Now it is
found by experience that the dry cells which are
only capable of furnishing on short circuit six to
ten amperes will last quite as long in bell work as
one which may give on short circuit twenty to
twenty-five amperes. Hence it is good economy
to buy them.</p>

<p>"What a fine sitting room you have here! (<a href="#Fig107">Fig.
107</a>, <i>f.</i>) When do you expect to fit it up?" said I.
Instantly reminding myself, however, that boys do
not want a sitting room, I inquired what they
intended to use this fine, large room for. They told
me that they had plans for making a machine shop
out of that. The idea had been suggested by a
counter shaft which still hung from the ceiling,
and they had discovered that the old mill wheel
would still roll over if the penstock were repaired.
I replied that I would see what could be done about
that sometime.</p>

<p>On the next day matters concerning the motor
boat engaged our attention.</p>

<h2><a name="X" id="X"></a>X<br /><br />
<small>HOW ELECTRICITY FEELS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">What</span> is more fickle and yet more fascinating
than a motor boat? On the morning
after my arrival at Millville the boys
wanted me to go out with them in the motor boat
on the mill pond, as our beautiful little lake is called.</p>

<p>Each one took a hand at trying to start the boat,
but although she had acted perfectly well the day
before, on this morning no one could get a single
explosion. The switch was closed. The gasolene
was turned on. The carburetor valves were set
at the mark. The spark coils responded with their
familiar buzz. She had been primed and, when she
had refused to respond to this treatment, the pet
valves were opened and the wheel rolled over several
times to sweep out the cylinders. But absolutely
nothing moved her&mdash;neither coaxing nor gibes.
Suddenly some one rolled the wheel over for the five-hundredth
time and she started and behaved well
all day.</p>

<p>All this would not have given us the slightest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
aggravation if we could only have found out what
was the matter and what it was we finally did to
correct it. But this we shall probably never know,
and hence we are worshippers of the motor boat
while we continue to distrust it and complain of it.</p>

<p>While the boat was running one of the boys noticed
that a binding post at the end of one of the spark
plugs seemed to be loose. He inadvertently put
out his hand to tighten it and received a terrific
shock. This raised the question among the boys,
why one gets a shock from some of the binding posts
in the electrical equipment but not from others. I
suggested that we run in and
call at the house to get my
portable measuring instrument
(<a href="#Fig110">Fig. 110</a>) and a little
lunch, and then go up to the
upper end of the lake and
take our time in examining
the electrical equipment of
the boat.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_193.jpg" width="250" height="371" alt="" />
<a id="Fig110"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 110</div>
</div>

<p>The engine had two cylinders.
There were two batteries&mdash;one
for each cylinder.
Each battery consisted of five dry cells like
the one represented in <a href="#Fig111">Fig. 111</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, why don't I feel the electricity when I
touch the binding posts of this dry cell?" inquired
one of the boys as he handled one of the cells which
we had taken out. "Well, I'll give you two reasons
why do you not feel it," said I. "First, because you
were touching only one binding
post at a time. You must touch
both of the binding posts of the
battery cell at the same time, so
that the electric current may pass
from one post to the other through
your body. Second, even when you
do touch both binding posts at the
same time you feel no current, simply
because you offered probably
about 100,000 ohms of resistance to
the passage of the current and inasmuch as the
one cell exerts only 1.5 volts of pressure, it could
send only about .0000015 of an ampere through
you. This you cannot feel.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_194.jpg" width="150" height="301" alt="" />
<a id="Fig111"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 111</div>
</div>

<p>
(1.5 volts)/(100,000 ohms) = .0000015 amperes.<br />
</p>

<p>"I now connect my instrument as a volt meter
between the binding posts of the cell and you see it
indicates 1.5 volts, and when I connect it for an instant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
as an ammeter you see it indicates twenty
amperes. That is twice as much as they use for
executing criminals by electricity. So you see if
you could reduce your resistance sufficiently this one
battery cell might kill you. Some people have
less resistance than others. The resistance of the
body is chiefly in the outer skin. If one's hands are
dry and his skin has been made tough and horny
by hard work, he has many times the resistance of
one whose hands are moist and whose skin is thin
and tender.</p>

<p>"Suppose we select the tip of the tongue as the
portion of the body which will offer the least resistance
and will be most sensitive to slight electric
currents. Let us then connect one dry cell with the
ammeter and place the tip of the tongue between the
bare ends of the wire at <i>T</i> (<a href="#Fig112">Fig.
112</a>).</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_195.jpg" width="200" height="155" alt="" />
<a id="Fig112"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 112</div>
</div>

<p>"I have connected the ammeter
so that it will indicate thousandths
of an ampere, and you
see that the needle moves only
slightly. We cannot call it more than .001 ampere."
Each boy in turn tried sending the current through
his tongue and each tried to tell how it felt. One
said it tingled, another said it felt warm, another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
said it tasted sour and the other said he did not feel
or taste anything. "Well," I said, "whether you
feel anything or not one-thousandth of an ampere
is passing through your tongue and you are offering
fifteen hundred ohms of resistance.</p>

<p>
(1.5 volts)/(1500 ohms) = .001 ampere<br />
</p>

<p>"Your hand offers nearly seventy times as much
resistance as your tongue. Suppose we try increasing
the voltage, or pressure, of our electric current.
We will connect in series the ten cells, making a
battery which you see by the volt meter gives fifteen
volts of pressure. We now find that having ten
times the pressure it sends ten times as much current
as formerly through the tongue."</p>

<p>
(15 volts)/(1500 ohms) = .01 ampere<br />
</p>

<p>Each one now testified that the battery sent all
the current he cared to take through his tongue. If
they send one thousand times as much as that
through a criminal no wonder it kills him. It
produces a twitch when the contact is first made,
afterward a decided sensation of warmth and acid
taste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>If we should increase the voltage tenfold more,
say the 110-volt dynamo current (direct current),
and touch the bare conductors with our hands, the
ammeter would indicate about .001 ampere. That
is, although this current has about seventy times as
much push, or voltage, as a dry cell, no more electricity
passes through the fingers than did through
the tongue in the preceding experiment with one
cell. The fingers offer so much greater resistance.</p>

<p>By wetting the fingers and pressing them firmly
upon the bare wires, we may make the ammeter
read .01, that is, we may increase the current tenfold
by reducing the resistance to one tenth. But
there is nothing disagreeable about the feeling. If
the same experiment is tried with the 110-volt alternating
current, although the quantity of current
which passes through the fingers is the same as before,
the tingling is more perceptible than in the case of
the direct current. If we join together seventy-five
dry cells, giving a voltage of 112, and press the bare
wires with our wet fingers, the ammeter will indicate
.01, but there is no tingling sensation, merely a
slight warmth. The battery current, being continuous,
causes no twitching of the muscles while the contact
is closed. The direct current dynamo furnishes
a slightly pulsating current. Hence, one may tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
by the feeling whether an electric current comes
from a battery or a direct current dynamo. The
alternating-current dynamo gives a surging of
electricity back and forth in the wires, and this may
be distinguished from the direct current by its
feeling; when, however, the number of alternations
per second is increased very greatly, one may receive
through the body considerable quantities of
electricity without feeling it. With a very high
frequency current one may put himself in circuit
and light a 16-candle-power lamp without any
disagreeable sensation.</p>

<p>The outer skin is our chief insulation. If it is dry
and well toughened by work it offers a resistance of
over 100,000 ohms upon gentle contact. A wounded
spot, or places like the tongue with moist, thin skin,
may offer a resistance as low as 500 ohms. If one
has a pin prick or a splinter in his hand which he
cannot locate, he may hold one bare wire of a 110-volt
alternating circuit in one hand and move the other
bare wire about on the suspected region, and
know when it reaches the spot by a tingling
sensation.</p>

<p>One may touch lightly the 220-volt direct current
and scarcely note any difference between this and the
110-volt direct current, because one is not very sensitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
to the difference between .001 ampere and .002
ampere passing through his body.</p>

<p>
(100 volts)/(100,000 ohms) = .001 ampere, <br />
and<br />
(200 volts)/(100,000 ohms) = .002 amperes<br />
</p>

<p>Physicians treat certain ailments by the use of
the electric current. For this purpose they invariably
use a pulsating or alternating current and reduce
the resistance by using metal handles and wet
sponges for contact with the skin, but even so a very
small amount of current passes. The moderate
twitching of the muscles seems to be the end sought.</p>

<p>Men who are supposed to be killed by electric
shocks often die from other causes. A man perching
upon an electric light pole, repairing wires, may come
in contact with a wire charged, say, to 2000 volts. He
may receive a shock which throws him in an unconscious
condition across another live wire which
burns its way into his flesh, or he may fall to the
ground and be killed by the fall. A workman may
hold a tool so as to short circuit a current through
it, making it red hot in his hands. So many men
who have been shocked into unconsciousness by
high voltage currents have recovered consciousness
later that we cannot say how much current is required
to kill a man. For the execution of criminals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
1800 to 2000 volts are used, and by special metal
contacts ten to fourteen amperes are forced through
the body.</p>

<p>The first execution of a criminal by electricity
was performed in Sing Sing Prison, New York State,
in 1890. There was at that time a hot controversy
among experts over the question whether death, or
merely unconsciousness, could be produced by electricity.
To be on the safe side the legislature passed
a law requiring that the electrocution of a criminal
should be followed immediately by the dissection
of his body. Only six states out of forty-nine
have thus far adopted that method of capital punishment,
five have abolished capital punishment,
and thirty-eight still prefer hanging to electrocution.
But it should be remembered that it is amperes, not
volts, that kill. One often hears the meaningless
expression, "he received 2000 volts into his body."
The volts indicate the pressure, analogous to pounds
per square inch of water pressure. Amperes of
electricity are analogous to gallons of water. It is
possible to have exceedingly high voltage of electricity
without amperes enough to do damage.
When one holds his finger near to a rapidly moving
leather belt and a stream of sparks passes between the
finger and the belt, the voltage may be 50,000 or even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
100,000, but the quantity in amperes is too small
to do any damage or even produce much sensation.
A similar thing is true when one produces sparks
by rubbing a cat's back, or lights the gas by a spark
produced by rubbing the feet upon a carpet. Such
sparks are miniature lightning discharges. The real
lightning does damage because it furnishes quantity,
measurable in amperes, as well as extremely high
volts of pressure.</p>

<p>At this point I was reminded by the boy who had
received a shock from the engine that morning that
he had touched only one binding post. How then
had he closed a circuit through his body, and how
could he receive such a terrible shock when there
were only a few battery cells to produce the electric
current. I replied that he had the distinction of
having encountered about a 5000-volt current. In
the language of the newspapers he might say, <i>Took
5000 volts and still live.</i> We must next proceed
to show how he really did close the circuit and how
the spark coil enables a battery of a few dry cells
to produce exceedingly high voltages.</p>

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>XI<br /><br />
<small>THE ELECTRICAL SPARKING EQUIPMENT FOR A
GASOLENE ENGINE</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Under</span> the shade of a great sugar maple,
with Millville Lake spread before us, we
took apart and examined the entire equipment
for producing the electric sparks to explode the
mixture of gasolene and air in the cylinders of our
motor boat. The engine has two cylinders. For
each cylinder there is a separate battery and spark
coil. Inasmuch as the electrical outfit is duplicated
for each cylinder it will be necessary for us to
consider the case of one cylinder only.</p>

<p>When this engine is running, 700 explosions per
minute are produced in each cylinder. In one-twelfth
of a second the following four events take
place:</p>

<p>1. The cylinder is swept clear of the products
of combustion formed by the last explosion.</p>

<p>2. Four drops of gasolene are vaporized and mixed
with one quart of air and pushed into the cylinder
by the pressure of the atmosphere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>3. This mixture is compressed by the piston in
the cylinder to about one-fifth its original volume.</p>

<p>4. The mixture is heated to its kindling temperature,
which is above 2000 degrees. It then burns
with a sudden expansion, which drives the piston
before it and pushes the crank which is concealed
in the lower end of the cylinder half-way around.
The crank is attached to the shaft, which carries
the fly-wheel upon one end and the propeller wheel
upon the other end. The momentum of the moving
parts&mdash;chiefly that of the fly-wheel&mdash;suffices to
accomplish the remaining half of the revolution.</p>

<p>That any machine could be devised which could
repeat these four events 700 times a minute was
unthinkable a few years ago.</p>

<p>The first men who thought that a gasolene
engine could be a practical thing were considered
visionaries, but now they are found to be more
practicable than steam engines. They are so efficient
that they compete with the steam engine upon
its own ground, and, in addition, they have opened
up regions of usefulness which the steam engine can
never exploit. So far as we can see, they have a
permanent monopoly of the navigation of the air.</p>

<p>It is with the fourth event mentioned above,
viz., kindling the explosive mixture, that we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
now concerned. The high temperature required
for this is obtained by forcing an electrical current
against resistance.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_207.jpg" width="200" height="606" alt="" />
<a id="Fig113"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 113</div>
</div>

<p>Five dry battery cells would very readily heat
a short piece of fine wire to a sufficiently high temperature
to explode the mixture, but it is impossible
to alternately heat and cool a wire twelve times a
second. It is too slow an operation. The only
other method known at present is to imitate the
lightning and force an electric current against the
resistance of the air with sufficient power to produce
the required heat. This, however, requires
an extremely high voltage&mdash;at least 5000 volts,
and our battery of five cells has not more than
seven and a half volts of pressure. The interesting
question then is, how does the spark coil enable
us to raise the voltage from 7 to 5000.</p>

<p>To help toward an understanding of the matter
I took seven small wire nails which I found in
the boat&mdash;they were sixpenny finishing nails. I
then took two or three yards of No. 24 insulated
magnet wire, such as is used upon electric bells,
etc. I use it more often than any other wire, and
always have some about the boat. I fastened one
end of this wire to one of the binding posts of a
dry cell (<a href="#Fig113">Fig. 113</a>), <i>a</i>, and attached branches <i>c</i> and <i>d</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
to it. The other end, <i>b</i>, was left free to act as a
switch for closing the circuit by touching it to the
remaining binding post.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_208.jpg" width="150" height="436" alt="" />
<a id="Fig114"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 114</div>

<a id="Fig115"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 115</div>
</div>

<p>One boy then touched the bare
ends <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> to the tip of his
tongue, while I touched repeatedly
the binding post with <i>b</i>. There was,
of course, no sensation. We now
wound a portion of the wire upon
the bundle of nails, laying on about
fifty turns. (See <a href="#Fig114">Fig. 114</a>.) The
tongue was now placed at <i>T</i> and
<i>b</i> was touched a few times to the
free binding post. A very decided
shock was felt, not while the end of
the wire was resting upon <i>b</i>, but
at the instant of touching and
again at breaking the connection.
The shock was noticeably stronger
at the instant of breaking than of making the connection.
There was also a spark formed when the
connection was broken, which did not appear before
the coil was made. We next wound on more of
the wire&mdash;about fifty more turns (<a href="#Fig115">Fig. 115</a>). When
now connections were made and broken at <i>b</i> the
tongue at <i>T</i> felt a much more decided shock, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
larger spark occurred at <i>b</i> when the circuit was
broken. Both the tongue and the spark indicate
that the voltage is creeping up very
rapidly in this series of experiments.
We next connected two cells in series,
then three, four, and finally five cells in
place of the one. The spark grew larger
and "fatter," as the boatmen say,
with each addition of a cell. It was
not pleasant to use the tongue in the
experiment after the number of cells
exceeded two. I removed the branch
<i>d</i> from the wire <i>b</i> and connected it to
the binding post, as shown in <a href="#Fig116">Fig. 116</a>.
I then removed the crystal from my
watch and poured into it a little gasolene.
I rubbed the ends of <i>b</i> and <i>d</i> together over
this, and when they separated the spark
which was produced would not light the
gasolene. We had made a coil which
produced a spark that looked like a
miniature flame, but still was not hot
enough to set fire to gasolene vapour.
It simply needs more iron in the core and
more turns of wire about it. Bringing
the ends of the wires together and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
separating them is somewhat like drawing an
arc with the arc light carbons. It requires a
vastly higher voltage to make a spark jump across
an air gap than it does to lead it across thus.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_209.jpg" width="600" height="316" alt="" />
<a id="Fig116"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 116</div>
</div>

<p>The kind of coil we have made (only larger)
is very much used in houses as a gas-lighting coil
(to be described later). It is very much used also
for exploding gasolene engines. It generally passes
under the name of the "make and break" coil.
The revolving shaft of the engine is made to push
together the ends of the wire and separate them at
the right instant to make the spark for explosion.
Of course this is done inside of the engine cylinder.</p>

<p>That type of coil does not offer resistance enough
to protect the battery, and dry cells soon run down
if used with it. The coils that we have in this boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
are somewhat different from that, the details of
which we cannot now entirely explain.</p>

<p>They offer enough resistance to cut the current
required of the battery down to one third what
the "make and break" coil would take and at the
same time they raise the voltage so much higher
that the spark will jump across an air gap without
being led across as an arc. Hence they are called
"jump spark" coils.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_211.jpg" width="150" height="270" alt="" />
<a id="Fig117"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 117</div>
</div>

<p>It will be remembered that when we were studying
the dynamo we produced an electric current by
moving a magnet. We may now add that an electric
current may be produced by simply changing
the strength of a magnetic field. The coil that we
have just made creates a magnetic field in the
region about itself whenever a current is passing
through it. The tongue at <i>T</i> (<a href="#Fig117">Fig. 117</a>) detects an
extra current while the magnetic field is being produced,
or while it is dying away, or it will detect
any slight variations in the strength of the current
which produces the magnetic field. It is customary
to distinguish between these two currents. The
battery current which produced the magnetic field
is called the primary current and the current which
is detected by the tongue is called the secondary
current. The primary current in our experiments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
had only a few volts of pressure, from one to seven.
The secondary current had many volts, as indicated
by the spark. If we rub the end of the wire <i>c</i>
across the binding post under <i>b</i> (<a href="#Fig117">Fig. 117</a>) no spark
occurs. The current does not in this case go through
the coil, and no secondary current is produced.
Whenever we touch the wire <i>b</i> to that post we have,
in addition to the primary current which has not
voltage enough to produce a spark, a secondary
current flowing in the same wire at the same time
and having voltage enough to produce a spark.
The primary current is continuous while the contact
is closed; the secondary current is momentary,
as the tongue detects, and is produced only while
changes are being made in the strength of the magnetic
field. We will now take another
piece of wire and wind upon the coil
about two hundred more turns, leaving
this outer coil wholly disconnected from
the inner one, (<a href="#Fig118">Fig. 118</a>). I connect <i>c</i>
and <i>d</i>, the terminals of what we may
call the secondary coil, with my
measuring instrument and I connect <i>a</i>,
one of the terminals of the primary
coil, with the battery. I then rub <i>b</i>, the other
primary terminal across the free binding post of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the battery. At the instant of closing the primary
circuit&mdash;that is, of building up the magnetic field&mdash;a
secondary current is induced in the secondary
coil, which lasts for only an instant, too brief a time
for the needle to measure it, although its motion indicates
both the presence and
the direction of the induced
current. While the primary
circuit remains closed&mdash;that
is, while no change is occurring
in the strength of the
magnetic field&mdash;the needle
returns to zero, indicating no
secondary current. But when
now the primary circuit is broken and the magnetic
field loses its strength, the needle indicates a
momentary current in the secondary coil and <i>in the
opposite direction from what it had been at first</i>.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_212.jpg" width="250" height="276" alt="" />
<a id="Fig118"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 118</div>
</div>

<p>If, therefore, I rapidly make and break the current
at <i>b</i> I produce an alternating current in the secondary
coil. I will connect <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> with a miniature
lamp and, resting a coarse file upon the free binding
post, I will rake the end of the wire <i>b</i> up and down
upon this file so that, as it dances along upon the
file, it will rapidly make and break the primary
circuit, and therefore rapidly change the strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
of the magnetic field. You notice that the lamp
lights up moderately well. It is being lighted by an
alternating current. I move the wire a little more
slowly and you see the flicker of the alternations.
According to the label upon the lamp it requires
ten volts, and our battery could not give that. We
have therefore "stepped up" the voltage as we
say and we have a veritable step-up transformer.</p>

<p>In this case the primary and secondary circuits
are entirely separate. It is a familiar fact that
different electric currents may pass through the
same wire at the same time without apparent conflict.
We send numerous telegraph despatches
through the same wire at the same time. It is
quite as easy for several pairs of persons to telephone
over the same wire at the same time as it is
for those same several pairs to carry on separate
conversations in the same room at the same time,
at, say, an "afternoon tea." We may use the same
wire at the same time to carry direct and alternating
currents. This fact was first discovered in 1902
by Bedell of Cornell University.</p>

<p>Primary and secondary currents do not require
separate primary and secondary coils to convey
them. They may or may not be connected into one
continuous coil. It is quite immaterial whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
they are connected or not so long as they are in the
same magnetic field. Indeed, it seems that the field
outside of the wire may be quite as important as
the wire itself.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_214.jpg" width="200" height="267" alt="" />
<a id="Fig119"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 119</div>
</div>

<p>We have now 100 turns in the primary and 200
turns in the secondary coils. Let us connect <i>b</i>
with <i>c</i> so as to make one continuous circuit of 300
turns. Let us then put a branch upon <i>b</i> to connect
with the battery, thus having 100 turns for the
primary circuit, and put a branch upon <i>a</i> to connect
with the lamp, thus having 300 turns upon the
lamp, (<a href="#Fig119">Fig. 119</a>). When now we
rub <i>b</i> upon the file, as before, the
lamp lights up more brightly than
before, indicating that we have
stepped up the voltage still higher.
Varying the strength of the magnetic
field induces a secondary
current and the voltage of the
induced current is determined, in part, by the
number of turns in the secondary circuit.
If what we have been saying is true we ought
to be able to get these same results from an
electric bell. To test this we connected wires with
<i>a</i> and <i>c</i>, (<a href="#Fig120">Fig. 120</a>), and since I knew that the secondary
current at <i>S</i> would be too severe for the tongue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
we decided to feel it with the hands. For this purpose
we want a larger surface than the wires themselves
offer for contact with the hands, and so I twisted
the bare end of each wire around
an iron spike. The four boys
then arranged themselves in line,
joining hands, and the boy at
each end of the line held a
spike in his free hand. Thus
we had put the enormous resistance
of four human bodies joined
in series in the secondary circuit. When now I
connected two dry cells with <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> (<i>P</i>, <a href="#Fig120">Fig. 120</a>)
the hammer of the bell acted, like the file in the
former case, as interrupter of the primary circuit.
As it rapidly made and broke the primary circuit,
it produced rapid changes in the strength of the
magnetic field and thus induced a secondary current
which the boys all felt. The fact that it forced
its way through four bodies shows that its voltage
was high. The high voltage was also indicated
by the spark which always occurred in the bell. The
primary circuit in this case has not more than three
volts while the secondary has more than a hundred.
We have it in our power to give the secondary
current almost any voltage we choose, with this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
limitation <i>each increase in voltage necessitates a
proportional sacrifice of quantity</i>. The watt power
induced in the secondary circuit cannot exceed
that contributed to the primary circuit&mdash;indeed
cannot quite equal it since there is some loss in
heat.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_215.jpg" width="250" height="270" alt="" />
<a id="Fig120"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 120</div>
</div>

<p>Suppose we operate a bell on a primary current
having three volts and .25 ampere, that is, .75 watt.
Suppose then the voltage of the secondary current
is stepped up to fifty times three, or 150 volts. The
quantity of secondary current will be found to be
somewhat less than one fiftieth of .25 or .005 ampere.
The 150-volt alternating current from the bell is
more tolerable than that from a 150-volt dynamo,
because the quantity is limited in the former case.</p>

<p>Our spark coil has a vibrator which acts precisely
like the hammer of the bell to make and break
the primary circuit and thus make rapid changes
in the magnetic field produced by the primary coil.
The primary coil of the spark coil is many times
larger than the coil of the bell, that is, it contains
many more turns of wire. It has much more iron
in the core. We use upon it five cells instead of
the two cells upon the bell. The result of all this
is that we have a much more powerful magnetic
field than that in the bell and many more watts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
of energy from which to induce a secondary current.
Now the number of turns employed in the secondary
circuit of our spark coil is very great, stepping its
voltage up to thousands where the bell induced
hundreds.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_217.jpg" width="300" height="359" alt="" />
<a id="Fig121"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 121</div>
</div>

<p>Suppose we now repeat our experiment in which
we tried to light the gasolene in the watch crystal,
using now the spark coil of the boat instead of our
small "home-made" coil. In <a href="#Fig121">Fig. 121</a>, B is the
battery of five dry cells. <i>S</i> is a switch. <i>V</i> is the
vibrator, which, like the
hammer of an electric bell,
makes and breaks the
primary circuit. Of course
the coil has a core of iron,
although that is not here
represented, and, of course,
the coil has many hundred
turns instead of the few here
represented, and of course
also it is built up of many
layers instead of one as here represented. The
secondary has very many more turns than the primary,
but those in which the primary current passes
are common to both circuits. There is also a
condenser&mdash;not here represented, and not to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
described in this book. The result of all this is
that the secondary circuit has a voltage of between
5000 and 10,000, and a spark jumps across the gap
at <i>c</i> between one sixteenth and one eighth of an
inch long. This spark is hot enough to light the
gasolene which I have put in the watch
crystal at <i>c</i>.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_218.jpg" width="250" height="273" alt="" />
<a id="Fig122"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 122</div>
</div>

<p>Let us return to the bell for a few minutes. I
have here a miniature lamp which requires 10 volts
and .1 ampere, that is, 1 watt, which I will connect
at <i>S</i> (<a href="#Fig122">Fig. 122</a>). When now I
close the primary circuit with
two cells at <i>P</i> you notice that
the lamp lights up, but faintly.
It is not receiving .1 ampere.
Remember we have only .75
watt at our disposal and this
lamp requires 1 watt. Hence it
is getting only three quarters enough energy. We
connect in a third cell and now it lights up to full
brilliancy. The resistance of this lamp must
be about 100 ohms.</p>

<p>
(10 volts)/(100 ohms) = .1 ampere<br />
</p>

<p>The resistance of the four boys might have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
60,000 ohms, and the voltage of the secondary
circuit might in that case have been, say, 150.</p>

<p>
(150 volts)/(60,000 ohms) = .0052 ampere<br />
</p>

<p>How does it happen that the secondary current
had a pressure of 150 volts on the boys but cannot
supply even the 10 volts required by the lamp?</p>

<p>Perhaps we can be brought to appreciate the
answer to that question best by asking ourselves
some others quite like it.</p>

<p>Why did not the man who built our mill two
generations ago locate it upon the small stream that
flowed near his house? The small stream was more
conveniently located for him and it has quite as
much fall as he got at the foot of this lake. We
sometimes express the fact by saying that the "head
of water" or the water pressure was quite as much
in one of these cases as the other.</p>

<p>One boy said that the stream sometimes gives
out. Another one said that it never did have water
enough to run that wheel. "Undoubtedly the
trouble is with the quantity," said I, "but I want to
show you that we cannot maintain the pressure
unless there is sufficient quantity back of it."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_220.jpg" width="250" height="300" alt="" />
<a id="Fig123"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 123</div>
</div>

<p>In <a href="#Fig123">Fig. 123</a>, suppose <i>A</i> represents a small, slim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
tank of water three feet high. The water-wheel
<i>W</i>, requires one gallon of water a minute pushed
along by a three-foot head of water pressure to run
it. The supply pipe <i>S</i> is bringing into the tank not
more than one quart of water
per minute. A gate at <i>R</i>
enables us to regulate the flow
of water, as we regulate the
flow of electricity, by using
more or less resistance. Now
it is evident that if we close
the gate, or partially close it,
and allow the tank to fill with
water, we may then open the
gate and run the wheel for a short time, but the level
of the water in the tank soon begins to fall and the
pressure grows less and the wheel stops moving. It is
just so with all generators of electric current. If we
take from them more than they can supply continuously
the voltage falls. This is notoriously true of dry
cells. Like the water tank represented in <a href="#Fig123">Fig. 123</a>,
they "run down" if used continuously to furnish,
say, one ampere of current, but they may furnish
it for a short time, the voltage rapidly falling meanwhile.
Then if given a short rest they "pick up" and
will again furnish full pressure. The voltage of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
dry cell falls somewhat when it is required to give
the very small amount of current required to actuate
a volt meter, say .015 ampere. Hence, our volt meter
will not quite correctly show what the voltage
of a single cell would be on open circuit. Notice
that, when I put one cell upon this volt meter the
needle shows 1.42 volts; but when I put four cells
in series upon it the needle indicates six volts, as
nearly as we can read it. That is, the voltage of
each cell in this case appears to be 1.5. What has
increased the voltage of a cell from 1.42 to 1.50?
Simply this: when .015 ampere, the amount required
by the volt meter, was taken from one cell it reduced
its pressure, but when a multiplier with ten times
the resistance was added we secured our reading
by using only .006 ampere of current, and this did
not appreciably reduce the true pressure of the cells.</p>

<p>The induced current from our bell when held
back by 60,000 ohms of resistance in the four boys
was able to push with 150 volts of pressure, and
.0025 ampere passed without noticeably reducing
this pressure, but when the same current was held
back by only 100 ohms in the filament of the lamp
nearly forty times as much current passed, and the
pressure dropped to something less than ten volts.</p>

<p>"We will try an experiment to show how the voltage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
will suddenly fall when we reduce the resistance
of your four bodies.</p>

<p>"Fill these two empty tin pails in which our lunch
was brought with water from the lake and sprinkle
in the salt left over from the lunch. Now twist
a bare copper wire around the bail of each pail
and connect these with the bell so as to get the induced
current from its magnet. (See <a href="#Fig124">Fig. 124</a>.)
Let the two pails of water be
the terminals of the two wires
at <i>S</i>. Now you four boys wet
your hands in the water and
then join hands, and those at
the two ends of the line put your
free hands upon the outside of
the pails of water while I close
the primary circuit. You of course feel the current
just as you did when you held the spikes in your hands
in a former experiment. But now you two end
boys put your free hands into the salt water, and you
instantly get a very smart shock. The resistance
is no longer 60,000. It has dropped way down to
2000, and if the voltage had remained at 150 you
would have received a terrible shock, but the voltage
has dropped down to five. It is as though you had
been pushing very hard against a post and it suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
gave way. You cannot push against a thing
which offers no resistance. So the voltage falls
when resistance is reduced, and particularly if the
source of supply has very little capacity. Here is
another experiment you must try when you go
back to the city. At a certain water faucet in my
laboratory the pressure is disagreeably high. The
water flows with great force and spatters badly.
We can easily reduce the pressure so that the water
will flow in a limpid stream. <a href="#Fig125">Fig. 125</a> shows the
situation; <i>f</i> is the faucet, and in the
pipe underneath the sink there is a
stop-cock <i>c</i>. This may be adjusted
permanently so that the faucet <i>f</i>
will act pleasantly. The same thing
is represented again at the gas stove.
Let <i>f</i> in the <a href="#Fig125">Fig. 125</a> represent a gas
cock at the stove. Suppose the
pressure is so high that the gas flames
pass more gas than is readily consumed.
It is possible to adjust a stop-cock
like c further back in the pipe so
as to produce hotter flames, get rid of
the poisonous fumes of half burned
gas, and cut down the monthly gas bills one half.</p>

<p>"My garden hose will usually throw a stream across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the street, which is very desirable when one wishes
to sprinkle the street, but this pressure is disastrous
when I wish to sprinkle the flowers. Turning
down the stop-cock at the nozzle makes it shoot a
smaller stream but more spiteful in pressure, knocking
the flowers to pieces and washing the soil away
from their roots. But if I partially close the stop-cock
at the side of the house where the hose is
attached I may have the stream of water flow as
gently as I choose.</p>

<p>"I should meet precisely the same situation if I
tried to ring an ordinary electric bell by a 110-volt
current, and I should use the same method of overcoming
the difficulty.</p>

<p>"The great virtue of the dynamo is that it can
furnish a large supply so that the voltage is kept
constant on a great flow of current.</p>

<a id="Fig126"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 126</div>
</div>

<p>"I have not forgotten the question, but have tried
to work toward its answer all this time. The question
is, why did Ernest get a shock this morning
when he touched only one binding post, and when
the battery of five cells is not capable of giving
shocks to any one who touches its binding posts
directly? We need one more diagram to give the
final answer. In <a href="#Fig126">Fig. 126</a> <i>e</i> represents the binding
post from which the shock was received. <i>B</i> is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
battery of five cells, <i>C</i> is the spark coil, <i>G</i> is
the engine cylinder, <i>f</i> is the spark plug. When
one wishes to start the engine he closes the switch
<i>S</i>. This makes a continuous conductor from the
battery to the metal cylinder
itself. As the engine rolls over
it closes the gap in the conductor
at <i>d</i> for an instant.
The primary circuit is then
completed and the current
passes from <i>B</i> to the cylinder,
through the metal of the
cylinder to <i>d</i>, then to the
coil <i>C</i>, where it passes through a portion of the coil
and then back to the battery. The vibrator on
the coil causes the magnetic field to rapidly vary in
strength. This induces a secondary current in the
whole coil which, because it passes through a very
great number of turns, has a high voltage. This
passes from <i>C</i> through <i>B</i> to the base of the engine,
then up the walls of the cylinder to the plug <i>f</i>,
then jumps across the gap at <i>a</i>, causing the spark
which explodes the mixture of gasolene and air in
the cylinder. The spark plug <i>f</i> is porcelain&mdash;an
exceedingly good insulator. Through the centre
of this passes a wire from <i>a</i> to <i>e</i>. The current<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
passes up this and back to <i>C</i>. Now the engine rests
upon the floor of the boat, and Ernest stood upon
the same floor. The wood of this floor when dry
and clean is a very good insulator, but when wet,
and particularly when wet with water that has ever
so slight an amount of any salt in solution, it becomes
a conductor for such high tension currents. When
therefore Ernest, standing upon the floor of the boat,
touched the binding post, <i>e</i>, this induced current of
high voltage found it about as easy to pass from
the metal of the engine cylinder through the wood
to his body and through his body to <i>e</i> as to jump
across the short air gap at <i>a</i>. There are two things
upon which he may congratulate himself.</p>

<p>"1. While the coil stepped up the voltage so high
it reduced the available quantity of the current,
so that the shock was a safe one.</p>

<p>"2. He received only a portion of the current which
passed. The major part of it passed across the gap
at <i>a</i>, otherwise we should have noticed that the
engine missed an explosion when he touched the
binding post."</p>

<p>The only part of this electrical outfit from which
one may receive a shock is that line from <i>e</i> to <i>C</i>.
The greatest difference in electric pressure is always
to be found between the two extremities of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
electric generator; as, for example, between the
carbon end and the zinc end of the battery, the positive
and negative poles of the dynamos; the right-hand
and left-hand end of this coil. Since the
right-hand end is connected by good conductors
with the metal of the engine and with the floor of
the boat and through it with our bodies, we are
in the same electrical condition as the right end
of the coil; but the left-hand end and the wire
connecting it with <i>e</i> are forced by the varying magnetic
field into a very different state of electric
tension, and it is insulated from the engine and
from us by the porcelain spark plug. We say that
the "difference in potential" between the two sides
of this system is 5000 to 10,000 volts.</p>

<p>The water in this lake flows through the stream
at the other end of the lake to the ocean. The
water of the ocean evaporates to form clouds.
Clouds drift over the land and drop their rain
to replenish the lake. The difference in water
level between this lake and the ocean is twenty feet.
A difference in water level is what makes it a water
power and it is what occasioned the building of
our mill. This difference of water level corresponds
in our electric generators to the difference
in potential. The difference in potential maintained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
by our battery of five cells when not producing
current is 7.5 volts. The difference in
potential between the two ends of our coil, when the
battery is agitating its magnetic field, is perhaps
a thousand times as much, or 7500 volts.</p>

<p>The boys took their swim in the lake and afterward,
while we were all on shore lying on the grass,
they brought up again the question of the machine-shop.
They were anxious to know if I had any
plans in regard to it. I said I had been thinking
about it a good deal over night but had been waiting
to hear their plans. Well, they thought it would
be good to have a turning lathe, but could not think
of anything else unless it might be a grindstone
run by power. I said I had thought of a Central
Station Electric Plant. At this they all sat up.</p>

<p>"Hydro-electric stations are the proper thing now,"
I remarked. "On the Rio Grande River in Colorado
they are constructing several plants where water
power will be utilized to generate electricity for
use more than one hundred and fifty miles away.
For transmitting electricity to such a distance they
step up the voltage, or electro-motive force as it
is called, to 100,000 volts.</p>

<p>They are harnessing the Au Sable River in Michigan
to generate electricity and transmit it at 135,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
volts e. m. f. to towns nearly two hundred miles
away. Electricians use e. m. f. for electro-motive
force, just as you boys use "exams." as slang for the
motive force in school.</p>

<p>Of course we are aware that since 1896 some of
the water power of Niagara had been converted
into electric power to run street cars and factories
and furnish electric light and electric heat as far
away as Buffalo, twenty-six miles distant.</p>

<p>About $18,000,000 are now being invested in
hydro-electric enterprises even in Mexico.</p>

<p>By this time the boys were all standing up and
staring at me, while Harold inquired if I were talking
in my sleep. "I have at any rate succeeded in waking
you all up," said I, "and what I have said is not altogether
a joke. Let me explain somewhat at length."</p>

<small>ELECTRICITY FROM CENTRAL STATIONS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Large</span> dynamos generate electricity very much
more cheaply than small machines can,
and machines which have a full load
continually produce the current very much more
cheaply than those which run upon very light load
part of the time. The largest central stations with
load evenly distributed for the whole day could
furnish electricity profitably at four cents per kilowatt
hour. There are many small electric lighting
plants which furnish current from sundown to midnight
only at fifteen cents per kilowatt hour, with
little profit. The transformer (<a href="#Fig127">Fig. 127</a>) makes
it possible to gather all this generation of electricity
for sparsely settled districts into large central
stations, located sometimes far away from the
consumer perhaps, where there is abundant power
in some water-fall, thus saving the expense of coal
for running the dynamos.</p>

<p>A few years ago there were no central stations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
for this purpose. Now according to the latest
census reports there are in the United States about
30,000 plants, including those which belong to
certain cities, that generate electricity for sale,
and there are twice
as many more isolated
plants to furnish
light and power in
factories, hotels, etc.</p>

<p>The money invested
in central
station business now
exceeds six billion
dollars, and the
annual output of
electric current is
sufficient to keep
eight billion 16-candle-power
carbon filament
electric lights
burning continuously night and day. All this has more
than doubled in the last five years. Central stations
are now furnishing about five times as much current
for heating, cooking, and charging automobiles as
they did five years ago. About one third of all the
central stations depend on water power.</p>

<p>We might take as the type of hydro-electric
central station, that is, one which generates electricity
by water-power, the Glenwood Station of
the Central Colorado Power Company. This station
has two 9000 horse-power water turbines.
Each water-wheel drives an alternating-current
generator which develops 4000 volts of e. m. f.
These water wheels and generators are shown in
<a href="#Fig129">Fig. 129</a>. The penstocks are to be seen coming
through the back wall of the building. They bring
water at 170 foot head, or about seventy-five pounds
per square inch static (standing) pressure. Three
huge transformers, each weighing twenty-six tons,
step up the e. m. f. from 4000 to 100,000 volts.
These are the cylinders shown in <a href="#Fig130">Fig. 130</a>. They
simply contain a great many coils of copper wire
with a vast amount of iron at the centre. They
accomplish in a large way what our spark coil
does in a lesser degree. But why go to all this
expense to produce such a dangerous and troublesome
voltage? The answer briefly is, that while it
is dangerous and troublesome the expense is not so
great as it would be to supply by any other method
the electric current required. Denver and numerous
other places, large and small, require electric
current. From one to two hundred miles away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
on the Grande River, there is vast power running
to waste. We have to choose on the one hand
between buying power in the shape of coal and
distributing power plants to those various localities
where electricity is needed, and on the other
using this water-power, which is now running to
waste, to generate electricity which we may transmit
and distribute throughout the one hundred and
eighty-five miles to Denver, Leadville, Boulder,
Dillon, Idaho Springs, etc. But electric energy transmitted
a long distance suffers great loss.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_237.jpg" width="600" height="501" alt="" />
<a id="Fig130"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 130</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Suppose, for instance, I needed to supply fifty
amperes at one hundred-volt pressure ten miles
distant from the generator, and had a conductor
the size of a trolley wire to bring the current. The
resistance of the trolley wire is one ohm for every
two miles, or five ohms. The drop in voltage is
found by multiplying the amperes of current by the
ohms of resistance. Ten miles from the central
station, therefore, the drop on fifty amperes would
be 50 × 5 = 250 volts. It would, therefore, be necessary
to maintain a pressure of 350 volts at the generator
to deliver the fifty amperes at 100 volts. The
energy supplied by the generator is 350 volts × 50
amperes = 17,500 watts = 17.5 K. W. The energy
delivered to the consumer is 100 volts × 50 amperes
= 5000 watts = 5 K. W. In order to deliver
fifty cents' worth of electricity per hour to
the consumer it would, in this case, be necessary
to generate $1.75 worth of electricity at the central
station. That is, about seventy per cent. of the
energy generated would be wasted in transmission.
If now we decide to generate this electrical energy
at ten times as high voltage it will be necessary to
transmit only one tenth as many amperes, or five.
In this case the drop in voltage would be 5 amperes
× 5 ohms = 25 volts. It would be necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
maintain 1025 volts of pressure at the generator to
deliver to the consumer the five amperes at 1000
volts = 5000 watts. That is, to deliver 5000
watts in this case we must generate 1025 volts × 5
amperes = 5125 watts, and less than 2&frac12; per cent.
of the energy generated would be lost in transmission.</p>

<p>If now the consumer must have his energy delivered
at 100 volts, we must introduce a step-down
transformer at his end of the line which may give
him 50 amperes at 100 volts = 5000 watts. This
transformer, being small, will cause a loss of 15
or 20 per cent., but if there were a very large amount
to transform it might be done with a loss of only
4 per cent.</p>

<p>It is not thought to be advisable to raise the
voltage at the generator higher than 4000. This
will not suffice to supply large working currents to
a greater distance than about six or eight miles.
For a distance of 10 miles 6000 volts are desirable;
for 50 miles 30,000 volts; for 100 miles 60,000 volts;
for 165 miles 100,000 volts; and for 200 miles 120,000
volts. Notice that in this table the voltage rises
at the rate of 600 per mile. Since it is not desirable
for the generator itself to produce a higher voltage
than 4000, we must depend upon transformers to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
produce these high voltages. Let us then consider,
a little more in detail, the construction of a transformer.
I have here some drawings of one which I
propose that we make in
the machine shop, and
use in our central station
equipment in the future.
We will procure the thinnest
and softest sheet iron
possible and cut out of it
a lot of pieces shaped like
the letter H with the
dimensions shown in <a href="#Fig131">Fig.
131</a>. These are to be
piled one upon another,
with strips of paper between,
until the pile is
1&frac12; inches thick. Then
four pieces of board are to be bolted to the sides
of these (<a href="#Fig132">Fig. 132</a>). The dimensions of each of
the four blocks, is to be 7&frac12; inches long by 3 inches
wide by 1&frac12; inches thick. Upon the cross bar of
the H we will wind 400 turns of No. 12 double cotton-covered
copper wire, bringing out the ends for
future attachments, and then wind on 1200 turns
of No. 10 double cotton-covered copper wire. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
wire will fill the space between the blocks as indicated
by the diagram in <a href="#Fig133">Fig. 133</a>. We will then
cut strips of the sheet iron 6 inches long by 1&frac14;
inches wide, and bridge across
the ends of the H, prying
open the leaves of sheet iron
and tucking them in between
as shown in <a href="#Fig134">Fig. 134</a>. We
shall then drill a hole at each
corner and bolt them in
place. Binding posts will be
placed at <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i> (<a href="#Fig134">Fig.
134</a>), and the two ends of the
No. 12 wire will be brought
to <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> and those of the
No. 18 wire will be brought to <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>. Going through
all this detail of construction has probably made you
lose sight of the essential features of this transformer.
Let us for a moment turn back and see what they are.
We have a large coil of wire 3 inches long and 7&frac12;
inches in diameter. It is composed of a coarse
winding and a fine winding, which we may designate
as the primary and secondary coils, if we choose.
Of course the only reason for having different sizes
of wire is so that we may send larger currents through
one than the other. The coil has a laminated iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
core, that is, it is composed of layers of sheet iron.
These layers are insulated from one another. This
is essential, although
we cannot explain why
now. But perhaps the
most essential feature
of the transformer is
that iron extends clear
around from one pole
of this electro-magnet
to the other. <a href="#Fig135">Fig. 135</a>
represents a section
through the coil made
in the plane of <i>e f g</i>
(<a href="#Fig134">Fig. 134</a>). The core
of the magnet is represented
as heavily shaded. The <i>magnetic
circuit</i> is said to be closed from
one pole of this magnet to the
other through the strips of iron
which pass across the ends and
down the sides of the coil. The
arrows show the path of the magnetic
circuit. The dotted portion
shows where the copper wire may
be supposed to have been cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
across. Inasmuch as the electric current is induced
in the secondary circuit by continually varying
the strength of the magnetic field as much as
possible, the alternating current is the most desirable
to use in the primary. If the direct current
were used an interrupter would
be necessary, which would of
course produce too much sparking
when any but low tension
currents are used in the primary
circuit. The most interesting
and curious fact about the
transformer is that the voltages
of the primary and secondary
currents are in exact proportion
to the number of turns in
the wire of the two circuits.</p>

</div>

<p>In our transformer the number of turns in the coil
between the binding posts <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> is 400 and the
number of turns between <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> is 1200. If now
we connect a 112-volt alternating current with the
binding posts <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, a volt meter connected across
between <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> will show 336 volts, and if <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>
be connected by a short wire, bringing in 1600 turns
into the secondary circuit, a volt meter connected
across between <i>a</i> and <i>d</i> will show a voltage of 448.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Or if, leaving <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> still connected by a short wire,
we connect the 112-volt alternating current to <i>a</i> and
<i>d</i> a volt meter connected across
between <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> will show 28 volts,
or if connected between <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>
it will show 84 volts, and if finally
the 112-volt current is connected
to <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> the pressure between
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i> will be 37&#8531;.</p>

<a id="Fig136"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 136</div>
</div>

<p>The story, then, of the central
station which we have chosen as
a type is briefly this: Falling water makes dynamos
revolve, generating a 4000-volt alternating
current. This current is sent through the primary
windings of transformers. The secondary windings
of these transformers have twenty-five times as
many turns as the primary coils. This steps up the
voltage from 4000 to 100,000, making it necessary
to send only one twenty-fifth as many amperes
over the lines as would be required at 4000
volts, and reduces the loss in transmission to
nearly one twenty-fifth. At the other end of the
line the current traverses the secondary windings
of transformers, and the consumer receives his current
from primary coils which may step the e. m. f. down
to any required volts of pressure, generally 110.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>Now I shall be glad to have you consider whether
this suggests any practicable problems for us here
in Millville.</p>

<p>The sun is nearly setting and I suppose the
family is expecting me home.</p>

<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII"></a>XIII<br /><br />
<small>ELECTRICITY FROM AN OLD MILL</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Millville</span> is only a name or rather a reminiscence.
There was once a village here,
but now its population has all gone with
the tide down the river, even its ghost appears to
have departed. The ruins have all fallen, except
the mill, which we propose to revivify.</p>

<p>I had built a summer cottage on the shore of the
lake, about one mile from the mill. The absolute
stillness of the place charmed me when worn out
by the noise and heat and dirt and smell of the
city. Here even the owl twittered softly as if
afraid to disturb the silence.</p>

<p>The silence which was such a boon to me seemed
to be oppressive to the younger members of the
family. To prevent therefore their becoming dissatisfied
with the place and wishing to go to other
resorts, I planned to have some of their best friends
spend much of the summer with us, and I encouraged
their plans for making use of the mill. I will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
offer this as an excuse for introducing electricity
into a sleeping valley. Indeed, electricity has
always disported itself there in the lightning, jumping
from cloud to mountain peak as I have seen it
nowhere else on earth.</p>

<p>The next time I saw the boys they had ambitious
plans indeed. The penstock at the mill was to be
repaired. The water-wheel was to drive an alternating
current dynamo. The voltage of this current
was to be stepped up by a transformer. It was to
be transmitted to the cottage and there the e. m. f.
was to be stepped down again by another transformer.
My wife suggested that if it interfered
with the simple life it would have to step down and
out. Harold, however, assured his mother that
they were going to simplify everything&mdash;even
the subject of electricity.</p>

<p>Their plans were: To light the cottage by
electricity; introduce a number of electric back
logs, with coloured glass bottles; heat the fireless
cooker by electricity; pump the water for the house
by electricity; run mother's sewing machine by
electricity; run the washing machine and wringer by
electricity; heat sad irons by electricity; percolate
coffee, wash dishes and run the vacuum cleaner by
electricity; operate the door bell and the telephone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
and wind the clock by electricity. I was sure that
if they carried out these plans they would stay in
Millville at least that summer, so I said go ahead.</p>

<p>We fixed the penstock. The boys estimated that
10 cubic feet of water per second would pass through
it. They said that a cubic foot of water weighed
62.5 pounds and 10 cubic feet weighed 625 pounds.
They said it fell at the rate of 7 vertical feet a second,
making 4375 foot-pounds per second. But 550
foot-pounds per second is one horse-power, hence
this is about 8 horse-power. Since one horse-power
is equivalent to 746 watts of electricity, we have,
if we could generate it without loss, said the boys,
nearly the equivalent of 6 kilowatts of electricity,
or about 54 amperes at 110 volts.</p>

<p>There were several things they wanted to know
before they could go further with their plans.</p>

<p>1. How many of these electrical appliances we
would be likely to use at one time.</p>

<p>2. How much current each device would require.</p>

<p>3. How much they must allow for losses in generating
the current, in transmitting it, and in transforming
it.</p>

<p>We assured them that we would never use more
than twenty amperes, say, two thousand watts at
one time. They might install a fuse, or circuit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
breaker in our line to protect their plant against
a greater load from us. I told them that they might
allow 20 per cent. loss of energy at the dynamo in
converting water-power into electric-power.</p>

<p>I would suggest generating their current at
115 e. m. f. and stepping it up to 460 for transmission
to us, and then stepping it down to about one
hundred and ten volts for our use. They might
count on about one-third loss on our supply, that
is, they would need to generate about three thousand
watts in order to deliver us 2000 watts.</p>

<p>I suggested making our line of No. 6 copper wire,
which has a resistance of two ohms to the mile.
The distance from the mill to the cottage is one mile,
and the complete circuit therefore would require
two miles of wire, or four ohms of resistance.</p>

<p>If we start with 3000 watts and lose 14 per cent.
in transforming we shall have 2580 watts to transmit.
If the voltage has been stepped up fourfold there
will be about 5.6 amperes to transmit which will
suffer a loss of 22.4 volts in passing through four
ohms of resistance on the line. The loss in transmission
will be about 5 per cent., and we shall have
on arrival at the cottage about two thousand four
hundred and fifty watts with a voltage of 437.6.
If now in stepping this down to one fourth the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
voltage, viz., 109.4, we lose 14 per cent., we shall have
left something over two thousand one hundred
watts, or nearly twenty amperes.</p>

<p>Assuming that you are able to generate 4800
watts of electricity and that 3000 watts must be
furnished for transmission to the cottage, you have
left 1800 watts, which will give you something over
fifteen amperes at 115 volts for use in your machine
shop. I suggest that we get a dynamo which will
generate both alternating and direct current&mdash;the
alternating current you will send to the cottage,
and the direct current you will have for use at the
machine shop.</p>

<p>But how is it possible for a dynamo to generate
both alternating and direct current at the same time?</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_251.jpg" width="300" height="139" alt="" />
<a id="Fig138"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 138</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/i_251a.jpg" width="100" height="124" alt="" />
<a id="Fig139"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 139</div>
</div>

<p>Recall that all dynamos are generators of alternating
current. If the brushes rest upon rings
upon the axle they send forth alternating current&mdash;but
if the brushes rest upon commutator bars
they send forth direct current. Now we will have
two sets of brushes, one pair of which shall rest
upon the rings on the axle, and they will collect alternating
current for the cottage, while the other pair
will slide over the commutator bars and collect
direct current for the machine shop. I have constructed
a model which will make it plain. Here is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
a piece of a broom handle (<a href="#Fig138">Fig. 138</a>), one foot long,
which shall represent the axle of an armature.
<i>a b c d</i> is a stout wire which represents the coil of
the armature. In this case it has no iron at its
centre. Nevertheless
it will serve as an
armature having one
loop of its coil left. <i>e</i>
and <i>f</i> are rings, sawed
from a piece of brass pipe, which fit snugly
upon the axle. Another ring of the brass pipe was
sawed lengthwise, as shown in <a href="#Fig139">Fig. 139</a>. These
two halves are also fastened upon the axle and one
end of the wire loop, <i>c</i>, is fastened to one of these,
and the other end of the loop, <i>b</i>, is fastened
to the other half of the ring. These two
halves of the piece of brass pipe are placed so
that their edges are near to each other but do
not touch on either side of the axle. The two ends of
this wire loop are also connected with the rings <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>.
A short wire connects <i>b</i> and <i>e</i> and another connects <i>c</i>
and <i>f</i> passing through the wood of the axle, as shown
by the dotted line. We will now revolve this loop
slowly about its axle in a strong magnetic field. To
produce this field I will send two amperes of electricity
through the coils of wire (<a href="#Fig140">Fig. 140</a>), which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
surround two iron pole pieces that are screwed into
an iron base. Between the poles <i>N</i> and <i>S</i> of this
electro-magnet we will thrust this wire loop and
revolve it as an armature very slowly. Meanwhile
I connect two wires to
my sensitive ammeter
and let their free ends
brush along on the rings
<i>e</i> and <i>f</i>. The needle of
the ammeter swings to
and fro for each half
revolution of the armature,
showing an alternating
current of .01 amperes. If this armature
had many turns of wire instead of this one loop,
if it had an iron core, and if it should revolve at
high speed, the results would differ in degree but
not in kind.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_252.jpg" width="350" height="321" alt="" />
<a id="Fig140"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 140</div>
</div>

<p>We will now move the wires which are acting as
brushes over to the metal pieces <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>. When
now we revolve the armature the needle swings to
the right, and just as the needle is about to swing
back each brush slides from the plate on which it is
rubbing to the opposite one and the needle gets
another impulse forward. If the armature is turned
rapidly the pulses disappear and the needle stands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
constantly at about .015 amperes. This then is
both an alternating and a direct current dynamo.
It simply needs more iron, more copper wire, and
more rapid motion, to give us the 4800 watts of electrical
energy we are seeking.</p>

<p>"But how shall we produce the current which we
wish to send around the spools of the field?" inquired
the boys.</p>

<p>"Connect the field with the brushes which rub
upon the commutator," I replied. "It will magnetize
its own field."</p>

<p>As good luck would have it, we found that the
ledge of rock which furnished the basis for the mill
dam was immediately underneath the floor at the
north end of the machine shop. Upon this we built
up a solid foundation for the dynamo. Our water-wheel
gave a speed of 240 revolutions per minute
to the counter shaft. A pulley of two feet in
diameter upon this counter shaft was belted to the
pulley of one foot in diameter upon the dynamo&mdash;thus
giving its armature a speed of 480 revolutions
per minute. We had to fix a governor upon the
water-wheel to keep this speed constant at varying
loads. The voltage is very sensitive to slight changes
in the speed of the generator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>We had next to plan what equipment we should
need for the machine shop and to decide where to
locate each machine. The first machine we installed
was a lathe adapted for use both with metals and
wood. Among the adjuncts of this were all sorts
of drills, chisels, circular saws, grinding and burnishing
tools, etc. The second machine located was
a small forge with an electric fan to furnish the
blast. These were followed by a small band saw
and a small planer. The fifth machine was a big
grindstone and the sixth was an emery wheel.
The boys had a long discussion, running through
several days, on the question whether these machines
should be belted to the counter shaft, and thus get
power directly from the water-wheel, or whether
each machine should be operated by an electric
motor attached to it.</p>

<p>Harold said: "Suppose I want to saw a piece of
wood requiring a horse-power, I must start an eight
horse-power water-wheel which will run a six-horse-power
dynamo which will operate a two-horse-power
motor that will revolve the saw. There is a loss
in each machine, and the lighter the load the greater
the loss. In order that the motor may deliver one
horse-power to the saw, it must receive from the
dynamo, say, one and one-half horse-power, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
order that the dynamo may deliver to the motor
one and one-half horse-power, it must receive from
the water-wheel, say, two horse-power. What is
the matter with my saving time and energy by
sawing off the block with my own right arm?"</p>

<p>"But," said Ernest, "you forget that this water-wheel
and the dynamo must run all the time by the
terms of our agreement with the cottage, and they
will run fairly well loaded, so that the starting of
the saw will not entail any such losses as you reckon.
Furthermore the water-power is running to waste,
anyway. You simply divert its channel when you
start all this machinery. That's all. And lastly,
if the saw requires a horse-power, as you say, your
right arm could not furnish it."</p>

<p>"Oh," interposed Dyne, "it would take a horse-power
to do it as quickly as the machine does, but
Harold simply proposes to take more time in sawing
the block and less in running the machinery. An
infant can do the work of a horse if you give him
proportionally more time."</p>

<p>"I don't like the idea," drawled Erg, "that this
machinery has got to be kept running all the time.
When will a fellow get a chance to sleep or go
a-fishing or have any vacation, with this central-station
machine shop on his hands all the time?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>I had inquired how the last two boys won their
nicknames of <i>Dyne</i> and <i>Erg</i> and had been informed
that one was very keen about dining and the other
had a great aversion for work. They had doubtless
seen these terms somewhere in their reading of
physics, but they appeared to have forgotten their
significance by a too familiar use of them. I told
them that these were sacred terms, the first being
a name for the unit of force, while the second designated
the unit of work. Both boys said that under
those circumstances they would like to shed the
names. The names, however, stuck and the boys
themselves might, I think, be said to exercise a
maximum of power with the least waste of energy.</p>

<p>This idea of running the plant continuously had
evidently received no attention hitherto and it
bid fair to quench all the enthusiasm until I came to
the rescue by proposing a storage battery.</p>

<p>If we can procure a battery in which we may store
energy, which shall always be on draught by merely
pushing a button, one which "is not injured by
overcharging nor too rapid discharging, nor even
by complete discharge"; one which is not injured
by standing idle for any length of time, either charged
or discharged; and finally one which "is practically
foolproof"&mdash;we want to try it. I propose that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
you appoint a committee to look into it. But at
any rate this enterprise must go on even if I have
to hire a man to live in the loft of the mill and keep
the machinery going.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_257.jpg" width="500" height="298" alt="" />
<a id="Fig141"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 141</div>
</div>

<p>"No man in the loft," said Dyne, "while I have
my rations."</p>

<p>"There will be no need for him so long as I can
store energy here," said Erg, "so let the job of
equipping the establishment go on in the regular
fashion."</p>

<p>After a long confab one evening at the mill we
settled upon the arrangement shown in <a href="#Fig141">Fig. 141</a>.
<i>D</i> represents the location of the doors and <i>W</i> that
of the windows. The equipment is designated as
follows: <i>A</i>, saw; <i>B</i>, planer; <i>C</i>, lathe; <i>E</i>, emery
wheel; <i>F</i>, grindstone; <i>G</i>, dynamo; <i>H</i>, forge; <i>I</i>,
storage battery; <i>J</i>, switchboard; <i>K</i> and <i>L</i>, counter shafts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
suspended from the ceiling. The water-wheel
is belted directly to the counter shaft <i>L</i>. This
revolves at the rate of 240 r. p. m. A two-foot pulley
on this shaft is belted to a one-foot pulley on the
dynamo <i>G</i>, giving the dynamo a speed of 480. A
4-inch pulley on this counter shaft is belted to
a 16-inch pulley on the grindstone <i>F</i>, giving the
stone a speed of 60 r. p. m., or one revolution per
second. A 32-inch pulley on shaft <i>L</i> is belted to an
8-inch pulley on the counter shaft <i>K</i>, giving a speed
of 4 times 240, or 960 r. p. m. 12-inch pulleys on this
shaft are belted to 6-inch pulleys on each of the
machines <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>C</i>, giving them a speed of 1920
r. p. m., and a 16-inch pulley on this shaft is belted
to a 4-inch pulley on the emery wheel, giving it a
speed of 3840 r. p. m. As soon as everything was
in running order, Harold took his mother down to
the machine shop and started all the machinery
going at once, and while they stood in the middle
of the room I heard him explaining to her how
she might find out the speed of each machine. He
said that she must start with the grindstone, because
that goes slowly enough to count. She held her
watch in hand and counted the number of revolutions
in a minute, as he directed, and found them to be
sixty. Then he asked her to judge how much larger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the pulley on the grindstone was than the corresponding
one on the counter shaft. She said that
she thought it looked four times as large. He told
her that she had it just right, and explained that
the shaft must move four times as fast as the stone,
or 240. "Now how fast do you think the emery
wheel is going?" She acknowledged that she had
no idea.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "when you get real used to it you
can tell by the tone a wheel makes just about how
fast it is going."</p>

<p>Then he explained how she might calculate its
speed by looking at the pulleys, and she found that
the counter shaft was going four times as fast as
the shaft <i>L</i> and that the emery wheel was going
four times as fast as <i>K</i>. Hence it was going sixteen
times as fast as <i>L</i>, or 3840 r. p. m. His mother said
she thought that it was fascinating to stand in the
middle of the room with the slowly moving grindstone
on one hand and emery wheel moving sixty-four
times as fast on the other hand and think that
they were propelled by the same water-wheel.
I handed Harold a speed indicator which I had just
received, (<a href="#Fig142">Fig. 142</a>), the mechanism of which was
all visible. Harold looked at it for a minute and
found stated upon it that the wheel <i>B</i> had 100 cogs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
and he very quickly inferred that the axle <i>A</i>, whose
screw threads fitted into these cogs, must revolve
one hundred times each time the wheel <i>B</i> revolves
once. The tip end of this axle had a soft rubber
cap <i>C</i>. Without suggestion
from me he
soon held this rubber
shoe against the end
of the axle of the emery
wheel and counted, not
thirty-eight, but thirty-six
revolutions of the
wheel of the speed indicator in one minute. This
puzzled him and he inquired how it happened that
the emery wheel made only 3600 rather than 3840
revolutions per minute.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_260.jpg" width="350" height="260" alt="" />
<a id="Fig142"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 142</div>
</div>

<p>"Well," said I, "we always have to count on belts
slipping some, particularly upon very fast moving
pulleys and upon very small pulleys. Here are two
belts to slip, and still you are losing only the effect
of one revolution of the counter shaft <i>L</i> in a minute.
Grind something on the emery wheel and you will
find that the belts will slip more. In fact, grinding
upon the emery wheel will compel the water-wheel to
go more slowly until its governor opens and gives
it more water. The water-wheel makes fifteen revolutions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
per minute and the emery wheel goes 256
times as fast as that. One pound of resistance at
the emery wheel is like 256 pounds of resistance at
the water-wheel. You notice the same thing when
you use the saw or planer, or even present a chisel
to a piece of soft wood in the turning lathe.</p>

<p>"The only machine here that it is important to
keep running at constant speed is the dynamo.
We shall probably notice the dimming of our lights
at the cottage every time you saw a block or grind
with the emery wheel or even polish with the felt
buffer, because the speed of the dynamo will slacken
for a moment and the voltage will drop a little."</p>

<p>In addition to sending electric current to the
cottage the dynamo was to keep the battery stored
all the time. Each machine had an appropriate
motor attached to it which could run it by drawing
current directly from the battery when the water-wheel
was not running. Thus if one wanted to
sharpen his pocket knife he merely closed a switch
at the lathe and used the small stone, or if he wished
to sharpen his lead pencil he put it in the lathe and
applied a chisel to it.</p>

<p>These motors were all adapted to the 110-volt
direct current and the battery contained fifty-seven
cells, each cell being rated a little under two volts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys frequently discussed possible combinations
in this system. I spent a great deal of time
loafing around among them in a comatose condition,
and they talked quite as freely when I was around
as when they were alone among themselves. One
day I heard Dyne say, "Suppose we should store in
a reservoir the water which comes down the penstock
during a day and store all the electricity it will
generate in a day in a storage battery, then at night
let the battery run the dynamo backward as a motor,
and that turn the water-wheel backward as a rotary
pump, we should have the water in the upper
reservoir to begin work with the next morning and
the problem of perpetual motion would be solved.</p>

<p>"Aw, why do you want to do all that," said Erg,
"when nature is doing it for us?"</p>

<p>Ernest said he had a better scheme than that. He
would turn the battery current on to all the motors
in the room and they would run the counter shafts
forward and the counter shafts would run the dynamo
forward and the dynamo would charge the battery,
and so you could keep up the motion perpetually
if you wanted to.</p>

<p>"Get out your pencils," said Harold, as he took
down a copy of Houston and Kennelly. "Let us
see how we would come out if we tried Dyne's proposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
for, say, twenty hours, storing the energy
from the falling water for ten hours in the battery
and then using this energy during the next ten hours
for re-storing the water in the upper pond. We will
say that the water-wheel furnishes eight horse-power
for ten hours&mdash;eighty horse-power hours."</p>

<p>I notice it is stated in this book that small dynamos
are usually unable to deliver more than 75 per cent.
of the energy impressed upon them, and storage
batteries and motors deliver about 80 per cent.
of the energy impressed upon them. The accounts
would, therefore, stand as follows:</p>

<p>We cannot give the account of a water-wheel
acting as a pump, because such a
machine has not yet been perfected. It is evident
however that if a water-wheel could be devised
that should be a perfect pump, the losses in this
chain of machinery are more than half; indeed,
the accounts show them to be 60 per cent.
We should, therefore, be able to return less
than half the water drawn from the lake each
day, and we should rapidly move toward
bankruptcy.</p>

<p>"Well," said Ernest, "my proposition is more
successful than that, because it sets out to be a fool
proposition."</p>

<p>It was first suggested by the snake who
undertook to swallow himself. Suppose the
account does taper down from eighty to one,
so does the snake, but he still remains "wise as a
serpent." Our account would stand as follows:</p>

<p>It is evident that while our energy would dwindle
continually we should never quite come out of the
little end of the horn, since any number may diminish
by 20 per cent. of itself indefinitely.</p>

<p>"Let us get at something practical," said Erg.
"How are we going to furnish electricity to the
cottage when the dynamo is not running? If we
put a storage battery at the cottage, how are we
going to store it having nothing but alternating
current up there; and if we attempt to transmit
current from our central station battery, how are
we going to get along with the drop in the voltage?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you how to do that," said Dyne. "They
want 20 amperes and the line offers 4 ohms of resistance.
That means a drop of 80 volts. We have
simply to provide a subsidiary battery of 48 cells,
which we may throw in series with our 57 cells when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
we supply electricity to the cottage, and then they
will have the right voltage for use out there."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Erg, as he rolled over, "they will
have the right voltage when they use 20 amperes,
but what will happen if they simply turn on one
lamp. The drop in voltage then will be (.5 amperes
× 4 ohms =) 2 volts; 105 cells at 1.8 volts a cell
will send out there 189 volts minus the drop of 2
volts, leaving 187 volts upon a lamp adapted to
110 volts, and it will immediately burn out. The
same thing would happen to any single piece of
apparatus if the current was turned upon it alone.
The only thing they could do if they wanted to light
a lamp, say in the middle of the night to take a dose
of medicine, would be to start up all together, all
their lamps, sewing machine, wringer, dishwasher,
fireless cooker, vacuum cleaner, etc., etc., to keep
down the voltage so that one lamp would not burn
out."</p>

<p>"I have read," said Ernest, "that they use
rectifiers, which convert the alternating into direct
current, for storing batteries. These are much
used over the country. Electric automobiles run
by storage batteries, and in the great majority of
communities there is no other electric current than
the alternating. So they would be helpless without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the rectifier. We should then get another battery
of fifty-five cells for the cottage and keep it stored by
using a rectifier with our alternating current.</p>

<p>"But all their equipment up there," said Ernest,
"is adapted to the alternating current. Of what
use would a direct current be to them?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Harold, "it is all the same whether
you have alternating or direct current on lamps,
cooking apparatus, etc., and I have understood that
they have motors which run on both alternating
and direct currents. If so, that would fix them up
all right."</p>

<p>The boys now turned to me for the first time to
inquire whether motors could be obtained which
would run on both alternating and direct current,
and I replied that small motors for running sewing
machines, vacuum cleaners, etc., were made which
would serve us, perhaps not economically, but as
they were the only solution to our problem we could
get along with them.</p>

<p>"Why don't they have alternating current batteries?"
inquired Erg.</p>

<p>"Well, it is time that we learned about the
nature of batteries," said I, "if you boys are going
to have two storage batteries to care for."</p>

<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>XIV<br /><br />
<small>DOING CHORES BY ELECTRICITY</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Chores</span> were my salvation in youth, and
those chores were not trifles. I was made
to feel that the whole family depended
on my milking the cows, bringing in the eggs, keeping
the wood box full of wood, the water pail full of
water brought from the old well, churning the butter,
feeding and watering the animals, and performing
a multitude of regular daily and weekly tasks.
As I grew older my responsibilities were allowed to
increase proportionally so that I might feel some
measure of the dignity of being a mainstay and a
support of the family. Long before I reached
manhood occasional opportunities were presented
for me to play the full part of a man. These
sometimes came during a temporary absence or
sickness of my father, but more often, as I learned
afterward, by his skilfully eliminating himself from
the situation so that I might try my powers.</p>

<p>We attempt in the present generation to furnish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
a substitute for the old time chores by our daily
programme in school or in summer camp, but I
often wonder whether this round of trifles can
make men. Can one grow great without having a
chance to feel occasionally that the world depends
upon what he does?</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">

</div>

<p>The great advantage of Millville to us all lies in
the fact that my wife is a good organizer. She
immediately saw that the introduction of electricity
into the cottage enabled her to assign chores to us
all. These chores were assigned so that the establishment
ran like clock-work. On Monday morning
in a large room, called the wash room, she arranged
the soiled clothes in five piles. Pile No. 1
contained sheets and pillow cases; No. 2, white
shirts, shirtwaists, and other starched clothes;
No. 3, underclothes; No. 4, towels, etc., and No. 5,
coloured clothes. Here stood a washing machine
run by electric motor and a wringer run by the
same motor (<a href="#Fig143">Fig. 143</a>). By the side of it sat a tub
for rinsing water and next to that a tub for bluing
water. Two boys placed a wash boiler over a
two-burner oil stove, put five pails of water into it,
and cut up one cake of laundry soap which they also
put in. When this was boiling hot, about half of
it was poured into the washing machine. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
other half was to take its place later in the washing
machine. The first pile of clothes was put in and
the motor run for five minutes. This batch was then
run through the wringer into the rinsing water,
and then again
through the
wringer into the
bluing water, and
then through the
wringer a third
time into the
clothes basket,
and hung upon the
line out doors in
the clear sunshine,
which did more
than all else to
make them sweet
and clean. A basket
of such clothes
from the line
makes you want
to plunge your
face right into it and take a good whiff. There
is nothing like it except a mow full of new hay.
The piles of soiled clothes follow one another through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
this series of tubs on about a fifteen to twenty
minutes headway, so that the whole family washing
is done wholly by two
boys inside of two
hours. Each pile after
the first is given ten
minutes in the washing
machine.</p>

<p>On Tuesday the

<p>On Saturday a lot of baking is done in a series of
fireless cookers (<a href="#Fig146">Fig. 146</a>).</p>

<p>The sewing machine runs
more than ever before. I
hear "It is such fun to sew
with an electric motor." And
the electric fan which Harold
installed for his mother over
the sewing machine "makes
that the coolest spot in the
house."</p>

<p>Chores do not take all of
the time, nor most of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
time. They are simply the important things which
must be done right on time. Meanwhile there is
plenty of time for other things and a vast lot
of experimenting goes on down at the mill.
It is my chief entertainment to stroll down there
every day and look on. One day I found this
project on trial: On the floor (<a href="#Fig148">Fig. 148</a>, <i>f</i>) of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
room over the wash room at the mill a large dripping
pan <i>A</i>, was set on blocks of wood so that one corner
was lower than the rest. A rubber pipe, <i>B</i>, brought
water to this pan from the mill pond, an inverted
faucet, <i>c</i>, regulating the flow. The overflow from
the pan fell into a funnel, <i>d</i>, the stem of which went
through a hole in the floor. A short piece of rubber
pipe connected this with the nozzle, <i>e</i>, of a gardener's
sprinkling can, which hung from the ceiling in the
compartment for the shower bath. Electric lamps
attached to a board, <i>g</i>, were inverted over the pan of
water, so that the bulbs of the lamps were immersed
in the water. The electric current for these lamps
was controlled by a switch, <i>h</i>, placed by the side of
the water faucet. When one wanted a shower he
could have it as cold or as hot as he chose by adjusting
properly the switch and the faucet. Moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
it was not necessary for him to wait, for warm
water flowed immediately.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_274.jpg" width="600" height="471" alt="" />
<a id="Fig148"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 148</div>
</div>

<p>In discussing this the boys said that a 32-candle-power
lamp used 110 watts, and that since 96 per
cent. of the energy supplied to the lamps went into
heat each lamp transformed 105 watts of electrical
energy into heat. But 100 watts sufficed to raise one
pint (one pound) of water five degrees in one minute.
They used seven lamps or about one horse-power, and
adjusted the flow so that the shower delivered one
quart of lake water per minute warmed for a tepid bath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_275.jpg" width="250" height="258" alt="" />
<a id="Fig149"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 149</div>
</div>

<p>The next time I sauntered down to the mill the
boys were working on what they called an electric
shower bath. They had fastened upon the wall
of the bath room an electric bell (<a href="#Fig149">Fig. 149</a>), and
placed on a shelf near by a battery of two dry
cells, <i>P</i>. The switch which closed this primary
circuit was on the wall by the side of the faucet
and electric heating switch (<a href="#Fig148">Fig. 148</a>). One of the
wires, <i>S</i>, for the secondary
circuit was carried up and connected
to the pan <i>A</i> (<a href="#Fig148">Fig. 148</a>).
The other wire was fastened to
a sheet of zinc about a foot
square, which lay upon the floor
of the shower bath. The idea
was that when one was taking
a shower bath, if he chose to vary his sensations he
might step upon the sheet of zinc, close the switch in
the primary circuit and let the secondary current pass
through his body by way of the shower. They said
that it was particularly prescribed for slow people.</p>

<p>Speaking of chores, of course the most insistent
chore was to keep the storage batteries stored.
This process gave rise to many questions, through
which the information contained in the next chapter
was brought out.</p>

<h2><a name="XV" id="XV"></a>XV<br /><br />
<small>ELECTRIC CURRENTS FROM CHEMICAL ACTION AND
CHEMICAL ACTION FROM ELECTRIC CURRENTS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Luigi Galvani</span> (1737&ndash;1798) of Bologna,
Italy, in 1786 unwittingly produced an
electric current from chemical action. Because
he was eagerly seeking other results he misinterpreted
this. Several words in the dictionary
are becoming either obsolete or misnomers. For
example, galvanism is an old-fashioned word for an
electric current. The expression <i>galvanic electricity</i>
is a relic of the abandoned idea that there are
several kinds of electricity, of which Galvani discovered
one. Galvanized iron is wholly a misnomer.
It is a name used for iron which has been coated
with zinc, and it suggests the idea that somehow
the zinc is coated upon the iron by means of an
electric current, whereas in fact it is done by dipping
the iron into melted zinc.</p>

<p>Alessandro Volta (1745&ndash;1827) of Como, Italy,
took up the discovery of Galvani, interpreted it
correctly, and perfected the method of producing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
electricity by chemical action. What these two
men really discovered was that it is possible to produce
continuous currents of electricity. Before
that electricity was known only by the instantaneous
discharge or spark. From the name of
Volta is derived the word volt, which designates
the unit of electro-motive force. The adjective
<i>voltaic</i> is synonymous with <i>galvanic</i>, as voltaic or
galvanic cell, voltaic or galvanic current. For a
long time it was thought that such an adjective was
needed to designate electric currents generated by
chemical action as a peculiar kind of electricity. We
no longer think of electricity which is generated
by chemical action as different from that generated
by a dynamo or from any other source.</p>

<p>For about seventy-five years after the discovery
of Galvani chemical action was our only method
of generating currents of electricity, and it is largely
owing to the inadequacy of this method of production
that so few uses for electricity were discovered
previous to the perfection of the dynamo about a
third of a century ago. Two things have conspired
to bring about this <i>age of electricity</i>. (1) The dynamo
reduced the cost of production from five dollars to
ten cents per kilowatt hour. (2) Mankind grew
extravagant, greatly increased the number of things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
which it considered necessary, and at length became
both able and willing to spend more for the things
which it demanded.</p>

<p>The so-called voltaic cell is of scarcely more than
academic interest now. The school which, as a
rule, follows half a century behind practical life,
has taught and still teaches the philosophy of the
galvanic cell with great particularity. It is now
being urged to undertake the teaching of the dynamo.
Meanwhile the dynamo has almost driven out of
existence all electric battery cells except the storage
cell and the so-called "dry cell," and each year the
dynamo is encroaching more and more upon the
territory of the dry cell. In the present day, when
a passenger upon a street car pushes a button to
stop the car, he uses, not a voltaic cell, but a 500-volt
dynamo current to ring a small buzzer, and it
costs the company not one-hundredth part as much
as it would to furnish him a battery equipment
to do the same thing. Small dynamos and magnetos
are displacing dry battery cells in the sparking
equipment of motor boats and automobiles.</p>

<p>We lifted a dry battery cell out of its pasteboard
case and found that it was contained in a
metal cup of sheet zinc. The top of this was sealed
over airtight with pitch, the purpose of which is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
prevent this "dry" cell from drying up. We dug
away the hardened pitch and found a black powder
which was distinctly moist. In case the pitch
becomes cracked or a hole appears in the zinc cup,
the moisture passes out and the cell ceases to act
as a generator of electric current.</p>

<p>The zinc cup had a lining of pasteboard on the
sides and the bottom, similar to the pasteboard
which enveloped the outside, only the lining was
quite moist. A corrugated rod of carbon about
an inch in diameter occupied the middle of the cup,
and the space around it was packed full of a mixture
of ammonium chloride, manganese dioxide, and
other substances like plaster, etc., which differ with
different cells. A dry cell which has been long in
use is quite apt to show stains upon its pasteboard
case. These are caused by holes which appear
in the zinc. The production of electric current by
the cell is dependent wholly upon a chemical action
between the zinc and the ammonium chloride which
results in the destruction of both. This chemical
action cannot go on without moisture.</p>

<p>The zinc cup of the particular cell which we were
examining appeared to be intact, and we proceeded
to dig out the black powder. Its black colour is
due to the manganese dioxide. Ammonium chloride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
is white. We lifted out the carbon rod and scraped
the zinc cup clean. The binding posts attached to
both the zinc cup and the carbon rod were left
intact. Into the zinc cup we now poured a tumblerful
of water and added about a quarter of its
volume of hydrochloric acid, setting the whole into
a large bowl to guard against disaster. Bubbles
of gas were formed rapidly, causing the liquid to
effervesce as a tumbler of soda water would do.
We inverted an empty tumbler over the cup so as to
collect this gas. In about two minutes we lifted
the tumbler, still holding its mouth downward,
and brought a lighted match to it. There was a
flash and the contents burned with a pale-blue flame.
Some of the zinc had united with some of the hydrochloric
acid and set free hydrogen gas, which is one
of the constituents of the acid. This is typical of
chemical actions. Something similar takes place
between the ammonium chloride and the zinc.
Three interesting things occur in this experiment:</p>

<p>1. Chemical action, just described, is produced.</p>

<p>2. Heat is produced. This was very evident
when we took the zinc cup up in our hands. It
was as hot as though boiling water had been put
into it.</p>

<p>3. An electro-motive force is produced. This we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
showed by connecting one end of a piece of copper
wire to the binding post of the zinc cup and the other
end of the wire to an electric bell. Another wire
ran from the bell to the carbon rod. When the
carbon rod was lowered into the acid the bell rang.</p>

<p>Within ten minutes holes began to appear in the
side of the zinc cup. The acid contents began to
flow out into the bowl, and not long after the zinc
fell to pieces. After fifteen or twenty minutes the
action began to grow less. The acid was being
used up as well as the zinc. If enough acid is added
the zinc will wholly disappear.</p>

<p>We have chosen substances which would produce
striking results in this experiment, but the same sort
of thing is going on about us continually.</p>

<p>One summer by the seashore I fastened a brass
plate upon my boat with two screws&mdash;one of brass
and one of galvanized iron. The plate was attached
below the water line so that it might be acted upon
by the salt water. Within three weeks the head
of the galvanized iron screw had entirely dissolved,
while the brass screw was as good as ever.
A galvanized iron screw near by but not in contact
with the brass was still in as good order as ever.
I had simply made an electric battery cell out of
the ocean by dipping into it zinc and brass in contact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>A most interesting relationship exists between
the three kinds of activity in the cell, which have
been mentioned, viz.: (1) chemical action; (2) production
of heat; (3) production of electric current.</p>

<p>As has been already noted, chemical action produces
heat. Conversely, if we apply heat to the
cell we greatly increase its chemical action. We
have also noted that chemical action produces an
electric current, but unless the current is allowed
to flow through some external channel like a closed
circuit of wire the chemical action is greatly restrained
or entirely checked.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_282.jpg" width="250" height="344" alt="" />
<a id="Fig150"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 150</div>
</div>

<p>In a glass tumbler I put a rod of pure zinc (<a href="#Fig150">Fig.
150</a>, <i>Zn</i>), and an electric light carbon,
<i>C</i>. A short wire, <i>a</i>, was arranged
for connecting the two
externally. In the tumbler was
put some water with about one
tenth its volume of sulphuric acid.
No chemical action was evident
until the wire was touched to the
zinc, closing the circuit. Then
bubbles of hydrogen gas gathered
upon the surface of the carbon rod, and clung to it
very tenaciously. We lifted out the carbon rod
and rinsed off the bubbles in another tumbler of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
water, and then returned the carbon to its place in
the cell. The experiment was repeated many times,
and each time no bubbles of hydrogen, which is in
this case the sign of the chemical action, appeared
until the circuit was closed for the flow of the
electric current. Incidentally it should be said
that the amount of hydrogen produced by the
chemical action is a measure of the amount of
electric current produced. Incidentally also it
should be said that the bubbles of hydrogen clinging
to the carbon rod check and almost stop
both the chemical action and the production of
electric current when the circuit is closed. If now
we put in sodium bichromate to use up the hydrogen
as fast as it is produced we may have a continuous
current whenever the circuit is closed. Chemical
action does not entirely cease in this cell when
the circuit is opened. But if two cells are prepared,
and one is left with its circuit closed while the other
remains with its circuit open, it will be found that
the zinc disappears and the acid is used up in the
closed cell in a short time, while these remain not
greatly changed for a long time in the cell on which
the circuit is open. No cell will remain forever
without chemical action, yet a dry cell which might
use up its zinc and ammonium chloride in a few hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
if the circuit is closed may be kept idle three or
four years, and still be able to furnish electricity
enough to ring a bell. Some persons feel defrauded
if the author of a book fails to give them all the new
words and conventional terms which belong to any
subject. For such here is a page or so.</p>

<p>It is conventional to speak of the electric current
as flowing from the carbon through the wire to the
zinc, although every one has suspicions that it may
flow in the other direction or even that it may not
flow at all. It is conventional to designate any part
of the circuit from which the current comes as
positive (+) to any other part toward which it
flows, this latter being considered negative to
the former and designated (-). The current
is conceived of as making a complete circuit, from
carbon to zinc through the wire and from zinc to
carbon through the liquid. Hence, the binding
post of the carbon rod is called the + pole and that
of the zinc is called the-pole, while the zinc rod
or plate beneath the surface of the fluid is called the
+ plate and the carbon is called the-plate. The
liquid is termed the electrolyte. The sodium
bichromate, introduced to cause the hydrogen to
unite with oxygen, is called an oxidizing agent or
even a <i>depolarizing</i> agent, and hydrogen collecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
upon the negative plate is said to polarize
the cell.</p>

<p>Hydrogen may be made to collect upon the
carbon or negative plate until the electric current
reverses its direction. The hydrogen is said to be
more - than the zinc. If we connect the zinc
and carbon rods with the wires bringing an electric
current from the dynamo we may make either one
positive as we choose, according to which is connected
with the positive wire. Hydrogen bubbles
will collect upon whichever plate we make the negative
one.</p>

</div>

<p>When we send an electric current from the dynamo
into this cell it is called an electrolytic cell, and when
it is used to generate an electric current it is called
a battery cell. In either case the electrolyte is
decomposed and put through a chemical change,
though the chemical action in one case is the reverse
of that in the other, and the direction of the electric
current in one case is the reverse of that in the
other. For example let us consider the case of a
zinc rod and a carbon rod immersed in sulphuric
acid and the external circuit closed. The current
passes as indicated by the arrows in <a href="#Fig151">Fig. 151</a>, and
the chemical actions result in hydrogen leaving the
sulphuric acid and zinc taking its place, forming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
zinc sulphate. This is a white salt and for purposes
of this experiment must remain dissolved in water.
So far we have been considering a generator of
electricity&mdash;a battery cell. We may introduce
something at <i>m</i>, say a motor, which will indicate
that an electric current is
flowing. At length the
cell ceases to generate
current and is, as we say,
"run down." Suppose
now we substitute a
dynamo in place of the
motor in this circuit,
connecting it so that the
carbon rod shall be its
positive pole and the zinc
its negative pole. We now call this an electrolytic
cell, (<a href="#Fig152">Fig. 152</a>). The current will decompose
the zinc sulphate. The
zinc will be coated upon the
zinc rod and hydrogen will be
procured from the water present,
of which it is a constituent, to form
again sulphuric acid as originally.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_286a.jpg" width="200" height="181" alt="" />
<a id="Fig152"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 152</div>
</div>

<p>We shall thus restore the conditions which
prevailed in the first case as represented in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
<a href="#Fig151">Fig. 151</a>. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is the chemist's designation of
sulphuric acid and ZnSO<sub>4</sub> is his expression for
zinc sulphate.</p>

<p>The experiment illustrates a storage battery so
called. It might better be called a chemical transformer.</p>

<p>It is wholly unnecessary that one rod be composed
of zinc. If we begin with both rods of carbon
immersed in a solution of ZnSO<sub>4</sub>, and send into this
cell the dynamo current, the carbon which acts as
the negative pole will be coated with zinc in a short
time, and we shall have in effect a rod of zinc and one
of carbon as before. After a minute or two we may
disconnect the generator and substitute in its
place a bell as indicator, and it will ring, showing
that we have transformed electrical energy into
chemical energy which is now being retransformed
into electrical energy. We say that we store electricity
by this means, which is, however, no more
true than that a farmer stores his farm in the bank
when he sells it and deposits the money until he
shall need it to buy another farm.</p>

<p>Here is a very beautiful blue salt. I will drop
a few crystals of it into a tumbler of water and dip
in two carbon pencils connected to the dynamo
current, using between fifty and sixty ohms of resistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
in the circuit so as to have two amperes
flowing. After a minute or two I lift out the negative
carbon and you see that it is well plated with
copper. The blue salt is copper sulphate. If we
weigh the negative carbon, both before and after the
experiment, we shall find that copper has been depositing
at the rate of one ounce in twelve hours. If
we reduce the current one half, making it one ampere,
it will deposit copper at the rate of one ounce in
twenty-four hours. One ampere will separate three
ounces of lead in a day from a solution of any lead
salt; it will separate .9 ounce of iron in a day from
a solution of any iron salt, and it will liberate from
water, which is a compound of hydrogen, one gallon
of the gas in ten hours. The amount of chemical
action is a measure of the amount of electrical energy
expended. Before the present form of commercial
wattmeter was devised electrolytic cells were used to
determine what the consumer's bill for electricity
should be each month. These chemical meters contained
a solution of zinc sulphate for the electrolyte
and both the positive and the negative plates were of
zinc. While the current is passing, zinc from the
solution is coated upon the negative plate and zinc
from the positive plate takes its place in the solution,
thus maintaining a constant strength of solution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>Here are three iron nails. I propose that you
plate one with zinc and another with copper and then
expose all three to the weather and see which will
rust. I propose that you replate all the spoons at the
cottage and the metal tops of the salt cellars with
silver. Electro-plating results better if done slowly.
Ten volts and .1 ampere will be sufficient current.</p>

<p>In the storage battery we generally use lead for
both positive and negative plates and dilute sulphuric
acid for the electrolyte. Hydrogen is liberated
at the positive plate and oxygen unites with
the negative plate. When the charging current is
cut off the chemical action reverses, and an electric
current is produced by the cell.</p>

<p>In all other batteries there is a destruction of one
plate and of the electrolyte, which cannot be fully
restored by a charging current, although in the case of
the lead and sulphuric acid combination the charging
and discharging of the cell may go on alternately
for a very long period without permanent change
or loss of any substance except water. There is,
however, plenty of loss of energy in this as in other
transformers. One hundred ampere hours of current
expended to charge a storage battery will yield from
seventy-five to eighty-five ampere hours while the
battery is discharging.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>The lead storage battery is, however, full of disappointments
for those who do not properly care
for it. It is irretrievably ruined if neglected and
allowed to charge too far, or discharge too far, or
evaporate too much water, etc. The voltage of
a lead cell must not rise above 2.2 nor fall below 1.8.
It must not be allowed to furnish at any one time
a greater number of amperes than it is rated for. It
must not stand idle too much. It must not be
cleaned up and put away for a period. In fact,
the lead-sulphuric acid battery is so poorly adapted
to our need that I feel disposed to try Mr. Edison's
new storage battery. This has nickel hydrate
packed in tubes of metallic nickel for the positive
plates and iron oxide pressed into pockets in a sheet
of metallic iron for the negative plate. A solution
of potassium hydrate in water is used for the electrolyte.
This is said to be uninjured by being emptied
out and left idle, as our batteries must be for
a large part of the year. The e. m. f. of this battery
is less than that of the lead battery, being only 1.2
volts. We shall therefore need ninety-six cells
(type <i>B-4</i>) for the machine shop and ninety-one
cells of the same kind for the cottage. Our dynamo
will be unable to charge at one time more than sixty
of these cells connected in series.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>The particular chore which you boys must perform
is to see that the voltage of these batteries
is maintained at about 1.2. It should be charged
up to 1.8 volt at least once a week and never
allowed to discharge to a lower pressure than one
volt. The level of the electrolyte must be maintained
one half inch above the plate by adding
distilled water occasionally.</p>

<p>A few years ago every student of chemistry
was more or less agitated by the thought that more
than half of every clay bank was composed of
metal nearly as valuable, or at least as costly, as
gold. This is aluminum. By all the methods
then known it was a very difficult and expensive
process to extract the metal from the clay. At
length, by the perfecting of the dynamo, the chemist
had under his control great and powerful electric
currents which enabled him to unlock any chemical
compound however refractory and isolate its elements.
As a result aluminum became common
enough and cheap enough for even kitchen utensils.</p>

<p>The metal calcium which a short time ago was an
exceedingly rare substance worth $40 an ounce is
now fairly abundant and cheap for chemical experiments,
although it has no qualities which will give
it an extended use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>Powerful electric currents, such as are obtained
at Niagara, enable us to combine elements into
hitherto unknown chemical compounds. Carbon
and silicon are made to unite to form carborundum,
which vies with the diamond for hardness. Carbon
and calcium unite to form calcium carbide, used
with water to form acetylene gas.</p>

<p>In such processes the intense heat of the electric
arc&mdash;perhaps 6000 degrees&mdash;is employed, together
with the electrolytic action of the current, to separate
and combine substances. Enormous currents
are used in the electric furnaces for producing
chemical reactions&mdash;from 1000 to 30,000 amperes
at a time.</p>

<p>Electric currents passing through the human body
expend their energy partly in heat and partly in
electrolysis. So simple and harmless a thing as
common salt would become a virulent poison if
it could be electrolized in the body into its elements
<i>sodium</i> and <i>chlorine</i>.</p>

<p>Let us make use of an electric current to decompose
water into its elements, hydrogen and oxygen.
I have a three-ounce wide-mouthed bottle (<a href="#Fig153">Fig. 153</a>)
and through its cork I pass two short pieces of No. 24
platinum wire by pushing a stout needle through
first. I fill this bottle with pure water and cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
a slight furrow in the side of the cork, where water
may drip out when the gas is produced in the
bottle. We crowd the cork firmly into the mouth of
the bottle and invert it. No water drops out. We
bend the ends of the platinum wires
into hooks and hang upon them the
wires bringing the dynamo direct
current. There is no evidence of
chemical action. Pure water is an
exceedingly poor conductor of electricity.
Let us now put about fifty-five
ohms of resistance into the dynamo
circuit, so that it will pass about two
amperes, and put a very small pinch
of salt into the water, which makes it so good
a conductor that its resistance may be ignored.
When now we close the circuit, as before, a brisk
effervescence takes place. Bubbles of gas rapidly
form on the platinum wires and break away, rising
through the liquid. Twice as many form on the
negative wire as on the positive one. As these
gases rise to the top of the bottle an equal volume
of the water drips out through the small hole in
the cork.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_293.jpg" width="200" height="377" alt="" />
<a id="Fig153"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 153</div>
</div>

<p>Two amperes of electricity will liberate two fluid
ounces of hydrogen at the negative pole and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
fluid ounce of oxygen at the positive pole, in five
minutes. Hence in five minutes the bottle should
be full of a mixture of two gases, two thirds of which,
by volume, is hydrogen and one third oxygen.
We will catch the water which drips out so that we
may measure it. The bottle being now full of gas
I shut off the current, and removing the cork I
bring a flame to its mouth. A very loud and startling
explosion takes place. We pour the water
back into the bottle, and it seems to fill it as well
as before. We have decomposed a few drops of
water&mdash;not enough to measure&mdash;into two gases,
one of which, the hydrogen, occupied two thirds
of the bottle, and the other, oxygen, occupied the
remaining third. At ordinary temperatures they
would not reunite, but when raised to their kindling
temperature they united, producing light, heat, a
loud noise, and the few drops of water which had
been originally decomposed by the current.</p>

<p>This is the electrolysis of water. I wonder if
any such chemical action took place in Ernest's
body when he received that severe shock on the
motor boat the other day.</p>

<p>It is significant that the "dry" battery cell must
be moist in order that chemical action may go on
in it. Compare with that fact several others that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
we may learn from observation, for example:
Baking powders must be kept dry to retain their
strength. That is, if they get moist chemical action
will begin in them, and the gas which is one of the
products of this chemical action will pass off. Now
it is the sole function of baking powders to produce
gas within the dough, and if the gas has wholly or
partially escaped they will fail to make the bread
stuff "light." The same reasons obtain for keeping
seidlitz powders and other effervescing salts, such
as vichy and kissingen, dry. It is to prevent the
chemical action which is provoked by the presence
of water. The same thing is true of the rusting of
iron, and the various kinds of corrosion of metals.
We may prevent such action indefinitely by keeping
them dry. Berries, fruits, meats, milk, eggs, grain&mdash;all
kinds of foods&mdash;are preserved from spoiling&mdash;from
chemical changes&mdash;by drying them and
keeping them dry. The same thing is true of wood,
paper, cloth, etc. A wooden fence post may last
from five to ten years. A fence rail, being less exposed
to moisture, may last two or three times as
long. The interior wood of a house may last a
century or two, while the exterior wood, being
exposed to the weather, may require repairs very
frequently. Shingles on the roof do not last as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
long as shingles on the side of the house. Those
on a steep roof last longer than those on a flatter
one. A pitch of at least forty-five degrees in a
roof is desirable to keep it dry. The north and
west sides of a house being least exposed to storm
in this climate last the longer. Precious books,
records, deeds, wills, etc., on paper must be preserved
in dry air. A sail will keep strong and white
if kept dry.</p>

<p>But it is impressed upon us by our experiences
that sunlight is even more potent than moisture
to produce chemical change. Photographic processes
are dependent upon the power of light to
produce chemical changes. The fading of our
tapestries and our garments, the tanning of our
skins, the development of green material in the
leaves of plants, all are evidently the direct result
of sunlight. A picture hung on the wall prevents
the wall paper behind it from being faded by
the light, or it prevents the wood behind it from being
turned yellow by the light. Folds in our garments
prevent them from being faded all alike. Very
many substances to be found in a chemical laboratory,
in a drug store, or in a kitchen must be kept
in the dark if they are to be guarded against chemical
change. No experienced housewife would let a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
barrel of flour or potatoes sit in the sun, and every
housewife knows that the sun is the best agent for
bringing about those chemical changes which she
desires. Hence she puts her bedding, her milk
pans, her bread box, her butter jar, etc., "out to
sun." She has open plumbing, that the sun may
enter those dark and dirty corners.</p>

<p>If you would guard a substance against chemical
change, keep it in a dry, dark place. We have
come to associate the sun and the weather as disintegrating
forces. Hence the south and east sides
of the building need most frequent repairs. Every
one who has made time exposures in photography
knows that the sunlight from the east is, as a rule,
two or three times as powerful as that from the
west. There is less moisture and dust in the air
to screen us from the early morning sun than from
the late afternoon sun. When there is enough
moisture in the air to make the sun look red, those
rays from it which would produce chemical action,
called actinic rays, are cut off. Photographic
processes are then exceedingly slow. It is like
exposing a plate in a dark room behind the ruby
glass.</p>

<p>But our daily experiences teach us that not only
moisture and light but also heat stimulates chemical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
action. We restrain chemical action by cold when
we put things in the ice box. We hasten chemical
action by heat when we put things on the stove.
Winter restrains all the chemical activities of nature,
and summer quickens all the vegetable and mineral
kingdoms into chemical activity. If we would
preserve a substance from chemical change we must
keep it in a <i>cool, dark, dry</i> place. Now those conditions
which will favour the chemical activity of
a battery cell will enable it to produce electricity,
and those conditions which will restrain chemical
action will enable us to preserve the cell from
running down.</p>

<p>But we have lately learned that other forms of
radiation besides light and heat exist and aid in
chemical action. We may produce radiographs&mdash;pictures
on photographic plates&mdash;without light
but with invisible rays, which are akin to light and
to electricity.</p>

<h2><a name="XVI" id="XVI"></a>XVI<br /><br />
<small>ELECTROCUTION AT MILLVILLE</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> old mill was infested with rats. My
wife laid down to the boys the principle
that good housekeepers were never
troubled with vermin of any kind. The rats' sole
occupation is to search for food. If you don't
feed them they will not stay with you. But the
boys said that they were glad of a chance to try an
experiment on the rats. So one day when I went
down to the mill I found them discussing the possibility
of killing the rats by electricity. Harold
said that he had read that it took much less electricity
to kill any animal than to kill a man, and he
would like to try, for instance, whether the shock
which they had received from a bell would kill a rat.</p>

<p>"Well, who's going to sit by," said Erg, "to close
the primary circuit when the rat happens to get
himself into the secondary circuit?"</p>

<p>"Make him close it himself by some device,"
said Ernest.</p>

<p>"They have a regular thoroughfare, a beaten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
highway, along by the wall, under the mill and up
through a hole in the floor of my bedroom," said Dyne.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">

<a id="Fig155"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 155</div>
</div>

<p>"Well," said Harold, "I propose an electric trap
which shall have two compartments. We will keep
cheese in the inner compartment, the walls of which
shall be of wires so that the rats
may see the cheese. The floor of
the outer apartment shall be
covered with wire, as shown in
<a href="#Fig154">Fig. 154</a>. The wires of the secondary
circuit from the bell (<a href="#Fig156">Fig. 156</a>) shall
be fastened to the binding posts <i>b</i>
and <i>c</i> (<a href="#Fig154">Fig. 154</a>). The partition <i>d</i>
shall be a swing door into the apartment
<i>A</i> where the cheese is. This is shown in profile
in <a href="#Fig155">Fig. 155</a>. <i>d</i> must act as a switch to close the
primary circuit through the bell <i>P</i> (<a href="#Fig156">Fig. 156</a>). We
will have three dry cells
in the primary circuit.
Now this is the way it
will work: A rat comes
up from under the mill with wet and slimy feet&mdash;just
suited for making contact for the electric current
to enter his body. The smell of the cheese attracts
him. He circles around the trap several times,
watching the cheese in apartment <i>A</i> through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
wire screen. He sees a narrow opening into this
apartment under the door <i>d</i>. He puts himself in
position upon the floor of the outer apartment
<i>B</i>, his feet bridging the gaps
between the two systems of
wires belonging to the secondary
circuit. When he thrusts his
head under the door and pushes
it, it swings in a little, bringing
one metal strip against another,
which belongs to the primary
circuit. This closes that circuit. He will never hear
the bell ring, for the electric current which will shock
him to death travels 186,000 miles per second, while
his sensations travel only sixty miles an hour.
If the involuntary recoil of his muscles does not
make him jump back, so that the door will shut
and stop the bell from ringing, Dyne will be awakened
and he will close the door, since we will put the
trap at that hole where the rats enter his bedroom."</p>

<h2><a name="XVII" id="XVII"></a>XVII<br /><br />
<small>THE TELEPHONE</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> telephone was the great invention of
our centennial year, 1876. Elisha Gray
and Alexander Graham Bell each claimed
to have been the inventor. It is quite probable
that each did discover it independently, but the
result of the long patent suit was that the court
awarded the claim to Bell. It is, therefore, known
as the Bell telephone.</p>

<p>Many who installed telephones during the first
few years of their existence had them taken out
again as nuisances. They are far greater nuisances
now than at that time, but the necessity of them has
come upon us and entirely enslaved us.</p>

<p>There were more than eleven billion messages
sent by telephone in the United States in 1907.
The capital invested in telephone business was
$814,616,004. The income for that year was
$184,461,747. All of these items had more than
doubled during the previous five years. In 1880
there were about eight times as many miles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
telegraph wires as of telephone wires. In 1907,
there were about eight times as many miles of telephone
wires as of telegraph wires. The Bell system
had 3,132,063 stations, and independent companies
had 2,986,515 stations in 1907.</p>

<p>The first telephone line ran from Salem to Boston,
Mass. This was in 1877. The next year the
first telephone exchange was established. It was
eight years before a telephone line was extended
from Boston to New York. On October 18, 1892,
the first telephone message was sent from New York
to Chicago. Previous to 1895 telephoning, like
telegraphing, was done by one wire, using the earth,
as we say, to complete the circuit.</p>

<p>But at about that time electric car and electric
lighting lines became so common that they interfered
with telephoning. These currents running in lines
parallel to the telephone wires induced currents in
them, and when a person put a receiver to his ear
for conversation he heard the hum of electric light
dynamos and the buzz of electric cars so loud that
conversation was quite impossible. The next step
was to introduce a return wire&mdash;the double metallic
circuit as we call it. Thus outside currents induce
equal and opposite currents in the two wires of the
circuit, which neutralize each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>It was this same year, 1895, that the "central
battery" system was introduced into telephone
equipment. This is not usually a battery at all,
but a dynamo.</p>

<p>The price of all electrical supplies in 1895 was
about one tenth what it had been in 1885, and at
the same time the goods were of far better quality.</p>

<p>Important telephone patents expired in this
year, and immediately private and independent
lines began to be established. It was also in
1895 that the telephone company began to use
an automatic registering device which enabled it
to charge telephone rates according to the number
of calls.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">

<p>The boys unscrewed the end of a telephone
receiver (<a href="#Fig157">Fig. 157</a>) and
found inside a permanent
magnet made of several
steel bars bolted together
(<a href="#Fig158">Fig. 158</a>). This was
shown to be a magnet by presenting a small pocket
compass to either end. The left-hand end of this
magnet proved to be its north pole by repelling the
blue end of the compass needle.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">

<a id="Fig159"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 159</div>
</div>

<p>On the left-hand end of the magnet was a small
spool of No. 36 copper wire, silk covered. It offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
75 ohms of resistance, and since it takes 2&frac12; feet
of this wire to furnish 1 ohm of resistance the spool
contains 187&frac12; feet.
A thin disc of soft
iron .01 inch in thickness
is held by the
hard rubber case very near to but not quite touching
this end of the magnet. We drew this disc to one
side, as shown in <a href="#Fig159">Fig. 159</a>, and connected the receiver
by wires to a magneto.
We turned the crank of
the magneto slowly and
the iron disk danced up and down, keeping
time with the revolutions of the armature.
The magneto furnished an alternating current,
which, when it flowed around the coil
in one direction, strengthened the pole of the
magnet, and in the reverse direction weakened
the pole. When the crank was turned so as to
produce twenty to thirty revolutions of the armature
per second the dancing of the disc sounded like the low
hum produced by the wing of a humming bird. When
a large, wide-mouthed bottle was brought near to
this the sound was greatly reinforced, as the sound
of a bee becomes louder when he appears at your
open window. We next replaced the iron disc and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
put on the cap again. We then connected the
receiver at <i>S</i> (<a href="#Fig160">Fig. 160</a>) and connected two dry cells
at <i>p</i>. When the primary circuit was closed the disc
vibrated in time with the hammer
of the bell making the same
tone. We substituted for the
bell a series of buzzers. The
smallest had an armature about
one inch long, while that of the
largest was about two inches
long. The shorter the armature
the faster it vibrated, and the higher was the pitch of
its tone. We arranged these as shown in <a href="#Fig161">Fig. 161</a>.
<i>A</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>, <i>E</i> and <i>F</i> are the buzzers. <i>B</i> is a battery of
two cells and <i>G</i>, <i>H</i>, <i>I</i>, <i>J</i> and <i>K</i> are springs of sheet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
brass which act as push buttons. By operating
upon these springs with one's fingers, as upon the
keys of an organ, it was possible to represent the
tones of a reed organ after a fashion. The armatures
are reeds and they are made to vibrate by electro-magnets.
We called it an electric organ. The
telephone receiver was connected at <i>T</i>, and the
wires which led to it were lengthened so that the
receiver might be a long distance away. The disc
in the receiver kept time with the armature of each
buzzer when it sounded and faithfully reproduced
its sound. But the strangest thing was that when
any two buzzers sounded together, or, indeed, if all
five buzzers sounded together, the receiver responded
to them all at the same time, so that a person in
another room or in another house, with the receiver
at his ear, might hear exactly what those did who
were in the same room with the buzzers. The
wires from the receiver were connected with the
coil in each buzzer so
as to get the induced
current, as
shown in detail in
<a href="#Fig160">Fig. 160</a>.</p>

<p>We took a telephone induction coil (<a href="#Fig162">Fig. 162</a>) and
fastened it to a board as represented in <a href="#Fig163">Fig. 163</a>, <i>I</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
One wire of the primary circuit was fastened to
the binding post <i>a</i>. The other wire from the primary
coil passed to the switch <i>S</i> and then to the
battery. From the battery the
wire ran to the binding post <i>b</i>.
<i>C</i> is a steel tuning fork. The
secondary circuit is closed
through a telephone receiver.
These wires are extended so
that the receiver is too far
distant for the tuning fork to be
heard through the air. When
the switch <i>S</i> is closed the tuning
fork acts as the interrupter for
the primary circuit, and it interrupts according to its
time of vibration. If, for instance, the fork gives
the tone of middle <i>C</i> on the piano it vibrates 256
times a second. It interrupts the primary circuit
256 times a second. It induces an alternating
current of the same frequency in the secondary
circuit. The diaphragm of the telephone receiver
vibrates in perfect time with the tuning
fork and produces the same tone as the tuning
fork. We had a series of tuning forks
giving a variety of tones, which we could substitute
one after another in place of this one. The receiver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
reproduced accurately the tone of each one
of them.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">

<a id="Fig163"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 163</div>
</div>

<p>We took a small induction coil (<a href="#Fig164">Fig. 164</a>) <i>c</i> and
fastened one end of the primary circuit to a battery,
<i>B</i>. The wire at the other end of the primary circuit
was bent into a hook <i>h</i>. This hook was adjusted
about a quarter of an
inch from the end of
the iron core of the
coil. The other wire
from the battery was
attached to the steel
strings of a piano, <i>P</i>.
When the coil <i>c</i> was brought over a string and the hook
<i>h</i> was allowed to pass beneath the string and touch
it very gently, the primary circuit was closed
through the string, which served as an interrupter
of the current and vibrated according to its tone.
The secondary coil, not represented in the figure,
was connected to a distant telephone receiver, which
reproduced the tones of the piano strings.</p>

<p>Producing a tone is merely a matter of making
something vibrate with the required frequency.
It may be a piano string, or a tuning fork, or a reed
of an electric buzzer, or the diaphragm of a telephone
receiver. If it vibrates 256 times a second, it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
produce the same tone as middle <i>C</i> on a piano;
if it vibrates 512 times a second it will produce the
<i>C</i> which is an octave above, and if 128 times a second
an octave below middle <i>C</i>. The human voice is
produced by vocal cords in the throat, which vibrate
with the proper frequency to give
any required tone. But how can
we make the human voice act as
an interrupter of the primary circuit?
An examination of the
telephone transmitter will supply
the answer to this question.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">

<a id="Fig166"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 166</div>
</div>

<p>The boys after taking the transmitter (<a href="#Fig165">Fig. 165</a>)
apart proceeded to make one which should answer
the purpose as follows: A block of wood about one inch
thick and three inches
square (<a href="#Fig166">Fig. 166</a>), <i>A</i>, was
hollowed out, making a
cone-shaped cavity
about one half inch
deep and one inch
broad. This cavity
was filled with small
pieces of graphite, <i>G</i>,
made by cutting up a
lead pencil. An old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
tin-type, <i>D</i>, was laid over this as a diaphragm
and tacked around the edges. A binding post, <i>E</i>,
passed through the block, its head being buried in
the graphite at the bottom of the cavity. The
binding post <i>F</i> furnished contact with the tin-type.
One dry cell was placed at <i>B</i> and the
sensitive ammeter was connected at <i>C</i>. The
needle showed that although a small current
was passing it was constantly varying in strength.
Tapping upon the table, walking across the floor
of the room, shouting, and particularly whistling,
caused variations in the conducting power of the
graphite and consequently variations in the current
strength. This is precisely the condition we wished
to produce in the primary circuit.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_311.jpg" width="600" height="169" alt="" />
<a id="Fig167"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 167</div>
</div>

<p>We next substitute for the ammeter at <i>C</i> the
primary and secondary coil of the telephone. In
<a href="#Fig167">Fig. 167</a> <i>T</i> is the transmitter, <i>B</i> is a battery of two
dry cells, <i>P</i> is the primary winding of the coils, and <i>S</i>
is the secondary winding. To this a telephone receiver,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
<i>R</i> is connected by wires long enough to
reach into another room. A person holding the
receiver at his ear could hear everything said
or done in the room where the transmitter was
almost as plainly as though he were present in the
room.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_312.jpg" width="600" height="129" alt="" />
<a id="Fig168"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 168</div>
</div>

<p>Two such transmitters were made and the second
one was placed in the room where the receiver had
been, while a second receiver was installed near the
first transmitter. The arrangement is shown in
<a href="#Fig168">Fig. 168</a>. <i>T</i> is the transmitter at one end of the
line and <i>T'</i> the transmitter at the other end. <i>B</i>
and <i>B'</i> are the batteries at each end, <i>P</i> and <i>P'</i>
the primary coils, <i>S</i> and <i>S'</i> the secondary coils and
<i>R</i> and <i>R'</i> the receivers. With this arrangement
two persons carried on a conversation with perfect
ease, holding the receivers to their ears, presenting
their mouths to the transmitters and speaking in
moderate tones. <i>H</i> and <i>H'</i> are hooks upon which
the receivers are to be hung when not in use. These
hooks act as switches to open and close the primary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
circuit. A spring normally pushes the hook upward
and closes the circuit, but while the receiver is
hanging upon it the circuit is open at this point.
Thus the battery is saved from running down when
the telephone is not in use.</p>

<p>The wires were finally extended from the mill
to the cottage and this equipment was installed at
each end.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the secondary circuit includes
two receivers and two secondary coils besides
the wire of the lines to offer resistance.</p>

<p>The receivers offer 75 ohms of resistance each. The
secondary coils offer 250 ohms each and the line
wires between the mill and the cottage offer
100 ohms. This makes a total of 750 ohms for the
secondary circuit. But the rapid alternations which
are induced in the secondary circuit impede the
electric current ten times as much as the resistance
already mentioned.</p>

<p>When considering alternating currents passing
through coils of wire we are obliged to take into
account two kinds of resistance:</p>

<p>1. Ohmic resistance.</p>

<p>2. Impedance.</p>

<p>"You boys understand the resistance to the flow
of the electric current, which we have so often measured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
in ohms. But I want to show you that there is
another kind of resistance which alternating current
meets. Here is a coil containing 1000 feet of No. 20
copper wire. I throw on to it, for only an instant,
the 110-volt direct current, and the ammeter reads
11 amperes, showing that it offers a resistance of
10 ohms to the direct current. I now throw on the
alternating current, and the ammeter shows only a
small fraction of an ampere. The surging of the
current back and forth induces a counter electro-motive
force, in the successive layers of the coil,
which we call <i>impedance</i>. In the experiment which
we have just performed <i>impedance</i> is fifty times as
important a factor as ohmic resistance. Impedance
depends chiefly upon the frequency of alternation.
The impedance in telephone circuits is
particularly large because of the extremely high
frequency of the alternations produced by the tones
of the human voice, these being usually not far
from ten times as rapid as those of alternating
currents in common use.</p>

<p>"We may estimate the total resistance of our
telephone circuit as equivalent to 7500 ohms.</p>

<p>"Our secondary coils have forty times as many
turns as the primary coils, and by means of them
the voltage is stepped up to somewhere near one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
hundred on open circuit. When closed through
the line, however, the voltage drops down to about
ten. The result is that the actual current which
passes between the cottage and the mill when we
telephone is not far from .001 ampere. We may,
however, hear a whisper transmitted by .000001
ampere or less.</p>

<p>"The tone <i>E´</i> which is produced by the tenth key
above middle <i>C</i> on the piano, is the one most
readily heard over the telephone. It is produced
by anything which vibrates 640 times per second."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_315.jpg" width="600" height="140" alt="" />
<a id="Fig169"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 169</div>
</div>

<p>We used No. 12 galvanized iron wire for our
telephone lines. Two miles of No. 12 copper wire
would offer 16 ohms of resistance. The iron wire
offers about 100 ohms. But this is a trifle
when compared with the total resistance. We
used a double metallic circuit so as to avoid the
effects of inductance from our electric lighting
circuit.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_316.jpg" width="200" height="236" alt="" />
<a id="Fig170"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 170</div>
</div>

<p>The next thing that we were obliged to consider
was some arrangement for calling persons to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
telephone for conversation. We decided to use
magnetos and alternating current bells. <a href="#Fig169">Fig. 169</a>
shows the essential mechanism of the bells. The
bell at each end of the line consists of two gongs
<i>a, b</i> and <i>a´ b´</i>, with a hammer <i>c</i>, <i>c´</i> between them.
This hammer is attached to an iron armature <i>h</i>, <i>h´</i>,
pivoted over the electro-magnets, <i>m</i>, <i>m´</i>, in such a
way that it rocks back and forth when an alternating
current passes through the lines <i>d e</i>, <i>f g</i>. The
bells at both ends of the line always ring together,
since they are connected in series. A magneto
(<a href="#Fig170">Fig. 170</a>) is situated at each end of the line. This,
as has been previously explained,
is a generator of electricity, in
which the field is furnished by
steel magnet, <i>M</i>. The armature
<i>A</i> is a coil of wire whose ends are
in contact with the leading out
wires <i>d</i> and <i>c</i> by means of brushes
which slide upon rings. The armature
is revolved by hand. The crank and cog
wheels employed to produce high speed are not
shown in the figure. By turning the armature
rapidly this magneto will develop 60 volts e. m. f.
on open circuit. The magnets of the bells are
wound with a very large number of turns of very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
fine wire, so that .025 ampere is sufficient to ring
them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_317.jpg" width="600" height="95" alt="" />
<a id="Fig171"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 171</div>
</div>

<p>Figure 171 shows how the magneto at either end of
the line is introduced into the circuit for the purpose
of ringing the bells. <i>B</i> and <i>B'</i> represent the bells,
<i>m</i> and <i>m'</i> the magnetos, and <i>P</i> and <i>P'</i> represent
switches. Springs push them upward so that they
normally close the circuit through the bells. When
a person at <i>P</i> wishes to call another at <i>P'</i> he pushes
the switch <i>P</i> down so as to bring his magneto <i>m</i>
into series with the bells. When now he turns the
crank and generates the electric current, both
bells ring. His own bell serves the purpose of
telling him that the line is operating all right.
The other bell calls the party desired for conversation.
As soon as the operator removes his finger
from the switch <i>P</i> the spring throws it upward
again, leaving his bell in circuit, so that he may be
called at any time, but cutting out of the circuit
his magneto, which would introduce unnecessary
resistance.</p>

<p>The same wires which carried the current for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
ringing the telephone bells carried also the current
for operating the telephone receiver. When the
receiver is removed from the hook it releases a
twofold switch. This serves the double purpose
of closing the primary circuit through the local
battery and substituting the telephone receiver
circuit for the bell-ringing circuit upon the line.</p>

<p>We used fifty chestnut poles to carry our line
between the mill and the cottage. Each pole had
a cross bar, on one end of which the electric light
and power wires were carried and on the other
end the telephone wires. Glass insulators prevented
the wires from coming in contact with the wood of
the cross bars. The necessity for this was impressed
upon the boys by something which happened while
they were stringing the wires. The telephone
apparatus at the mill had been installed and the two
leading out wires had been connected to it. One
of these was coiled up on the floor, while the
other had been strung along upon the poles for half
a mile, but had not yet been attached to the insulators
on the poles. While the boys were lunching at
the mill, one of them gave the crank of the magneto
a turn, when, to the astonishment of all, the bell
rang. The circuit had been completed through the
damp wood of the mill, through the damp wood of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
some of the poles, and through the earth. After
lunch the wire, so far as it had been strung, was
fastened to the insulators upon the poles. But
when some one turned the crank of the magneto
the bell still rang. We walked along the line to
see where the difficulty was. We found the end
of the line about half a mile from the mill dangling
free from the ground, but touching a tall spear of
grass. When this was moved away from the spear
of grass the magneto could no longer ring the bell.
The slight current required to ring this bell&mdash;.025
ampere&mdash;had found its way through the spear of
grass, through the woodwork of the mill and
through the earth.</p>

<p>We had no sooner got the two telephone wires
properly strung and attached to the hundred glass
insulators when a thunder storm came up, and drove
us back to the mill for shelter. Pretty soon the
bell rang and we, supposing that some one at the
cottage was trying to call, went to the instrument,
but could get no response, nor could we make
the bell ring. Lightning had sent an alternating
current over the line which rang the bell,
but the strength of the current was too great
for our coils of fine wire and one of them was
burned out, as we say. In other words, the wire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
had melted at the point where it offered the greatest
resistance.</p>

<p>The burned-out coil was replaced, and then we
installed lightning arresters which were of two kinds.
The first were simply fuses which were introduced
into the line to protect it against any current too
large for the apparatus to carry, and the second
was a plate, <i>c</i> (<a href="#Fig172">Fig. 172</a>). These are to
be found upon the top of the magneto
cases. A wire is connected with <i>c</i>,
and its other end is grounded by being
connected with a piece of iron pipe
which is driven deep into moist earth.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_320.jpg" width="150" height="161" alt="" />
<a id="Fig172"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 172</div>
</div>

<p>The plate <i>a b</i> is inserted in the line, and the gap
between this and the plate <i>c</i> offers sufficient resistance
so that the telephone circuit suffers no leakage
at this point, but lightning has such extremely
high tension that it readily passes across this gap
and finds its way to the earth without damaging
the instruments.</p>

<p>We have already noticed that our alternating
current dynamo, which produces 60 vibrations per
second in the telephone receiver, causes it to give a
tone very nearly like the <i>C</i>, which is two octaves
below middle <i>C</i> upon the piano. <i>C</i> requires 64
vibrations per second. We may speed up our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
dynamo so as to make it yield a tone exactly like
<i>C</i> or even above it.</p>

<p>Dr. Cahill of Holyoke, Mass., has devised an organ
in which alternating current dynamos produce the
necessary number of vibrations for each tone. The
name <i>telharmonium</i> has been proposed for this
organ. It has a separate dynamo for each tone,
each dynamo having a frequency corresponding
to the tone required of it. The dynamo, for instance,
which produces middle <i>C</i> makes the electric currents
surge back and forth 256 times a second, and this
causes the diaphragm of a telephone receiver to
vibrate 256 times a second, and this sends forth 256
air waves per second, and when these reach our ears
we recognize the tone we call middle <i>C</i>. The frequency
of alternation in a dynamo may be increased
by either increasing its speed of revolution or by
increasing the number of coils upon its armature.</p>

<p>Mr. Cahill's great organ looks like a large machine
shop with many counter shafts geared so as to run
at different speeds. On each shaft are a large
number of little dynamos whose armatures have
various numbers of coils. The organist, who may be
far removed from this "machine shop," fingers an
ordinary keyboard. Each key opens and closes a
switch, thus bringing into action its own dynamo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>If the key which is known as <i>C</i>, one octave below
middle <i>C</i>, is pressed down, a switch closes the circuit
between the telephone and a dynamo which
gives 128 double alternations of current.</p>

<p>The tone which is produced by 128 vibrations
per second is the one most often heard from a man's
voice in ordinary conversation.</p>

<p>Another key brings into action upon the same
telephone receiver&mdash;and at the same time if
desired&mdash;a dynamo which gives twice as many
alternations per second and produces the tone most
often heard in female conversation. It is middle
<i>C</i>.</p>

<p>Another key might bring into action a dynamo
which gives 64 vibrations per second to the diaphragm
of the telephone receiver. This would send forth a
tone very nearly like the base note of our 60-cycle
alternating current dynamo.</p>

<p>The following table shows a series of ten tones
which might be produced by the same little piece
of sheet iron in a telephone receiver played upon by
ten dynamos at the same time. The whole list
of ten tones would sound well when produced
simultaneously. The great mystery is that the
iron disc can vibrate in such a complex manner.
It is important to note, however, that the number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
vibrations in each of the upper tones is a multiple
of that of the lowest tone:</p>

<p>All the intermediate tones, with their sharps and their
flats, are produced each by its own separate dynamo.</p>

<p>The insignificant amount of current required to
operate a telephone receiver makes it possible to
furnish the music of these dynamos to many and
far distant telephones. This naturally suggests the
idea of having a great musician perform upon the
keyboard and have many auditors scattered about
the city in their private homes or even in many
public halls, for the telephone receiver can readily

<small>ELECTRIC BELL OUTFIT FOR THE COTTAGE</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> boys asked me what arrangement of
electric bells we needed at the cottage
and so I gave them this problem to work
out by themselves:</p>

<p>1. We want a bell in the kitchen to be rung by
a push button at the front door. But there are
times when no one is in the kitchen and hence,</p>

<p>2. We want a bell upstairs to make a single stroke
whenever the kitchen bell is rung from the front door.</p>

<p>3. We want a floor push under the dining-room
table which will cause the kitchen bell to ring a
single stroke.</p>

<p>4. We want a push button in the dining-room
which will cause both bells to clatter and call people
from their beds, from the piazza, the lawn, etc.,
to their meals.</p>

<p>This equipment needs only one battery of two
dry cells, two bells, three push buttons and about
two hundred feet of wire. It should cost less than
five dollars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys drew many plans and tried many
schemes and at last determined upon the plan
shown in <a href="#Fig173">Fig. 173</a>.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_325.jpg" width="350" height="506" alt="" />
<a id="Fig173"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 173</div>
</div>

<p><i>P</i> is the floor push under the dining-room table.
When the circuit is closed at this point the current
leaves the battery from
the carbon pole <i>c</i>,
passes up and around
the magnets of the
kitchen bell and back
to the zinc pole of the
battery <i>z</i> by way of
the push button <i>P</i>.
All other circuits are
open.</p>

<p><i>P´</i> is the push button
at the front door.
When the circuit is
closed at this point
the current leaves the
battery at <i>c</i>, passes up to the right-hand binding post
of the kitchen bell and divides, part going through
each bell. The portion of the current which goes
through the kitchen bell passes around the magnets
and through the armature to the left-hand binding
post before it can find a path back to the battery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Hence, the kitchen bell clatters. The portion of the
current which passes to the upper bell goes around
its magnets and finds a path back from the middle
binding post to the battery by way of <i>P´</i>. Hence
the bell upstairs rings with a single stroke.</p>

<p><i>P´´</i> is a push button situated upon the wall by
the side of the door which leads from the dining-room
to the kitchen. When the circuit is closed
at this point, the current leaves the battery at <i>c</i>,
passes up to the right-hand binding post of the
kitchen bell and divides, part of it going through each
bell. The portion which goes through the kitchen
bell passes around its magnets and through its
armature to the left-hand binding post, then up to
the middle binding post of the upper bell, through
its armature to its left-hand binding post and back
to the battery by way of the push button <i>P´´</i>. The
other portion of the current passes directly up to
the right-hand binding post of the upper bell, around
its magnets, and through its armature to its left-hand
binding post, thence back to the battery by
way of the push button <i>P´´</i>. Hence, both bells
clatter and keep time with each other. The upper
bell will ring independently of the lower bell, but
the lower bell is dependent upon the upper one to
open and close its circuit, somewhat as a relay.</p>

</div>

<p>Soon after the cottage had been equipped with
electric bells I went to the mill one day and found
a push button at the door. Upon going in I was
curious to examine the
electric bell outfit of
that place and found
what is illustrated in
<a href="#Fig174">Fig. 174</a>.</p>

<p>A switch, <i>S</i>, had been
attached to the bell.
The boys said that
when they felt well
they kept the switch
upon the left-hand
point and the bell rang
as a clatter bell. When
they felt a little sick
they put the switch
upon the middle point and the bell rang with a
single stroke, but when they felt very sick they
put the switch upon the dead point and the bell
did not ring at all.</p>

<h2><a name="XIX" id="XIX"></a>XIX<br /><br />
<small>USING ELECTRICITY TO AID THE MEMORY</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">For</span> the sparking equipment of the motor
boat we use dry cells which have an
internal resistance of not more than .06
ohm. They will, when short circuited through the
ammeter for only an instant, give 25 amperes.</p>

<p>
(1.5 volt)/(.06 ohm) = 25 amperes<br />
</p>

<p>When we allow for a slight resistance in the ammeter
itself, and for the drop in voltage, we see that
the internal resistance of a cell must be even less
than .06 ohm.</p>

<p>After being used about two months upon the
motor boat these cells develop more internal
resistance, and they will then show not more than
six to ten amperes when short circuited through an
ammeter. They are then not reliable for ignition
of the engine, but are quite as good as ever for bell-ringing,
and often continue so for more than a year.
The result is that we always have more partly run-down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
dry cells than we can use. Seeing them about
has stimulated the boys to devise ways for using
them.</p>

<p>The housekeeper is distracted by carrying on
so many cooking processes at one time. She forgets
the eggs, and lets them boil five minutes instead
of three because the coffee must percolate twelve
minutes, and she lets the coffee percolate twenty
instead of twelve minutes because the biscuit must
bake twenty minutes, and the biscuit are forgotten
because the pies must come out in thirty minutes,
and the cake in forty minutes. All this worries
the cook. Harold
is a sympathetic
boy and enters
into the troubles of
others. I had at
one time shown
him how to bore
a hole in a glass
plate in five or ten
minutes by using a round file wet with water.
One day he presented the kitchen with a clock,
intended to relieve the burdened memory of the
cook. This is represented in <a href="#Fig175">Fig. 175</a>.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_329.jpg" width="400" height="277" alt="" />
<a id="Fig175"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 175</div>
</div>

<p>An ordinary kitchen clock had a hole bored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
through the glass which covers its face. This glass
is easily moved around in its metal rim, bringing
the hole over any desired minute upon the face.
One wire of the battery is attached to a leg of the
clock, the other goes to a bell, and then the wire
from the bell is poked through this hole. When
the minute hand reaches that point the electric
current is closed through the metal of the clock,
and the bell rings warning that the eggs, coffee or
what not are done.</p>

<p>We each urged that our memories should share
in the vacation, and applied for one of these outfits.
I took one of the clocks and cut back the minute
hand so as to make it shorter than the hour hand,
and then had the hole in the glass made so that
the hour hand should close the electric circuit.
This was kept at my study table and reminded me
of my appointments. Some used these clocks to
alarm themselves in the morning when they slept
overtime.</p>

<p>Another reminder is shown in <a href="#Fig176">Fig. 176</a>. <i>C</i> is a
float which rises and falls with the water in our
house tank. A cord running over two pulleys connects
this with a weight, <i>d</i>, hanging in front of a
scale upon the wall of the kitchen. This indicates
how much water there is at any time in the tank,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
which is situated in the garret. The boys arranged
a bell and battery so that when the tank is nearly
empty the weight <i>d</i>
will pull upward a
spring, <i>a</i>, and make it
close the circuit
through the bell to
warn that water must
be pumped. When
the tank is nearly full
the weight <i>d</i> pushes
down the spring <i>b</i> and
rings the bell again.</p>

<a id="Fig176"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 176</div>
</div>

<p>Harold said that
yeast cakes were the
heaviest tax upon our
memories. If some
one started for the village store, before he got out
of hearing, a call would come after him, "I forgot
the yeast cake. Please put that on the list."
When one returned from the village store with
numerous packages, he would generally hear, "My
yeast cake was forgotten." We tried all sorts of
schemes to get rid of this yeast-cake nuisance,
and finally adopted Harold's "curled bread" project.</p>

<p>We had built a brick oven out back of the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
for experimental purposes. Harold proposed that
the boys bake a month's supply of bread at a time,
and, when it was a day or two old, cut it all into thin
slices and let it dry. These slices curled up as they
dried and were known as "curled bread." A flour
barrel was filled with it each month. It kept perfectly
any length of time. The family voted it
to be better than crackers and better than fresh
breadstuff of any kind.</p>

<p>Harold's suggestion regarding yeast cakes worked
so well and was such a relief to our memories that
I proposed he next attack the problem of the often
forgotten salt in cooking.</p>

<h2><a name="XX" id="XX"></a>XX<br /><br />
<small>THE ELECTRIC BRICK OVEN</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">We had</span> no end of experiments with brick
ovens. One of the most interesting was
that wherein we used the brick fireplace
as an oven and did the family baking in it. On a
cold morning we would build up a smart wood
fire in the fireplace and enjoy it during breakfast
time. Then we shovelled out the coals and the
ashes, and shut it up tight with a sheet iron arrangement
and utilized the heat stored in the bricks
for doing all sorts of cooking.</p>

<p>Our outdoor brick oven and our monthly baking
day were such a success that they led to the construction
of another oven of smaller dimensions for
the kitchen. This one was heated by electric lamps&mdash;one
in each of the eight corners. It had double
glass doors in front so that the cooking process
might be watched. The glass of the inner door
would be clouded with moisture for a while, when
the cooking first began, but this would soon clear
up, and then the lamps enabled us to watch the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
colour changes in baking, etc. The lamps in the
upper part of the oven were connected with a
different switch from those in the lower part of the
oven, so that we were able to control the browning
on top or bottom at pleasure.</p>

<p>Harold introduced a device for automatically
controlling the temperature of this oven.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_334.jpg" width="400" height="273" alt="" />
<a id="Fig177"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 177</div>
</div>

<p>Strips of brass and iron, <i>B</i> and <i>I</i> (<a href="#Fig177">Fig. 177</a>), were
riveted together. These were fastened in the socket
<i>A</i>. They are shown edgewise in the diagram.
The upper end of this compound strip is free to
bend back and forth in the plane of the paper, as
here represented. They normally touch the screw
<i>C</i>. One of the electric light wires runs from the
lamps in the oven to this screw <i>C</i>. One wire of
the dynamo circuit <i>G</i> goes to the lamps, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
other connects with <i>A</i>. Thus the compound strip
acts as a switch to open and close the circuit upon
the lamps.</p>

<p>This thermostat, as it is called, was placed inside
of the oven. Heat causes brass to expand
more than iron and therefore when the temperature
reaches a certain height the thermostat curves,
so as to break the contact with <i>C</i>, and the lamps go
out. When the temperature falls a little the
thermostat straightens until contact is again made
with <i>C</i>. <i>C</i> is a screw and can be made to advance
or recede in its socket <i>E</i>, so that the temperature
of the oven may be maintained at any point desired.
The wire of the screw <i>C</i> extends to the
outside of the oven,
where it carries an index,
<i>D</i>, over the face of a
dial, as shown in <a href="#Fig178">Fig. 178</a>.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_335.jpg" width="300" height="304" alt="" />
<a id="Fig178"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 178</div>
</div>

<p>The cook may set this
index at any desired degree,
and the lamps will
indicate when that degree
has been reached.
The thing to be baked
is then put inside and the clock, illustrated in <a href="#Fig175">Fig.
175</a>, is set so as to warn when the time is up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>The electric spark which occurs when the thermostat
breaks contact with <i>C</i> causes the metals to corrode
at that point, and corroded metals are poor
conductors. This corrosion is due to the oxygen
of the air. There is one metal&mdash;the expensive
platinum&mdash;which is not corroded by the electric
spark. We drilled small holes in the end of the
screw <i>C</i> and in the brass strip and pounded into these
holes little pieces of platinum wire. Harold said
he felt like a dentist filling a tooth. This furnished
good, clean contact at all times.</p>

<p>It takes a long time to heat up the brick oven,
but it holds its heat a long time and makes an excellent
fireless cooker after the lamps are turned
out. It does not allow heat to escape into the
kitchen, which makes it a comfort in our summer
cottage. We are all becoming daft on <i>slowly cooked</i>
food&mdash;a sort of ripening process which gives time
for the chemical changes to take place and develops
the finest flavours of the food.</p>

<h2><a name="XXI" id="XXI"></a>XXI<br /><br />
<small>ELECTRIC WAVES</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Much</span> has been said about bringing young
people up to do what they don't like to
do so as to make them strong and virtuous.
My own life has always been guided by a different
principle. It is: <i>Find something worth while which
you will enjoy doing, and do it with your might.</i> I
am bringing up my boy on the same principle.
In September we have a real desire to get back to
our work in the city, and in June we have an eager
longing for the occupations of Millville. I am not
aware that there is any part of my work which I
would like to be relieved from, and Harold and his
mother said that they were now ready to return to
the city apartment with real pleasure for a winter.</p>

<p>One evening we were seated about the dinner
table when Harold asked me how electricity could
travel without wires. I replied, "It travels as
light does. But I am very much puzzled to know
why it ever follows a wire when light does not."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
This did not settle the question and left us both
unsatisfied, so I told him to invite two or three of
his best friends in to-morrow evening, and I would
perform some experiments for them that would at
least help them to think further upon this subject.</p>

<p>When the evening came I showed the boys an
automobile spark coil to which I had attached two
knobs, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> (<a href="#Fig179">Fig. 179</a>), and with which I had connected
two dry battery cells. When I touch the
wire <i>c</i> to the binding post <i>d</i> a spark passes between
the knobs <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. When this spark occurs at
least four kinds of waves pass out in all directions
from the spark gap between the knobs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_338.jpg" width="600" height="261" alt="" />
<a id="Fig179"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 179</div>
</div>

<p>First, sound waves go through the air. Our
ears detect these. If the air is removed from around
the apparatus no sound wave can go forth. A
careful examination of the internal ear shows us that
it is constructed so as to respond to such air waves.</p>

<p>Second, light waves go forth. These affect our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
eyes. We are blind to the first kind of waves and
deaf to the second. The light waves travel without
air&mdash;somewhat better without air than with
air. A microscopic examination of the eye indicates
that it is constructed so as to respond to waves.
We believe there are waves in the ether which fills
all space. Sound waves travel in air at the rate
of one mile in five seconds. We had this nicely
illustrated at the sea shore one summer. The
steamer touched each morning at a wharf which we
could plainly see two miles distant. We could see
the steam arise when she blew the warning whistle,
and with our watches we found that it always required
ten seconds for the sound to reach us after
we saw the steam of the whistle. This at least
showed us that it takes five seconds longer for sound
waves to travel a mile than it does for light waves
to travel the same distance. For light had to travel
the same distance before we could see the steam arise
from the whistle. Although the time it takes for
light to travel a mile is inconceivably small, we have
a simple method of finding out that it requires eight
minutes for light waves to come to us from the sun.</p>

<p>The satellites of the planet Jupiter, in revolving
about that body, disappear and reappear at regular
intervals, acting as flash lights to mark time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_340.jpg" width="300" height="708" alt="" />
<a id="Fig180"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 180</div>
</div>

<p>The earth, being 92,000,000 miles distant from the
sun, is 184,000,000 miles farther from Jupiter when
at <i>B</i> than it is when at <i>A</i>. (See <a href="#Fig180">Fig. 180</a>.) It is
found by observation that
sixteen minutes more are
required for the light waves
from a reappearing satellite
to reach us at <i>B</i> than when
we are at <i>A</i>. Hence eight
minutes would be required
for light waves to travel the
distance from the sun to
the earth. Although light
travels at the inconceivable
velocity of 186,000 miles
per second, the nearest star
is so far distant that it
takes light three and a half
years to come from it to us.
The North star requires
forty-two years to send its
light to us, and Arcturus is
so far away that waves of
light sent out from it one
hundred and sixty years ago are only just reaching
us now, and if it should cease to send forth light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
now men would continue to see it for five
generations yet to come.</p>

<p>A third kind of wave which goes forth in the ether
from the spark gap of our coil is a heat wave. This
affects neither our eyes nor our ears, but I will undertake
to make you conscious of it by another method.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_341.jpg" width="250" height="123" alt="" />
<a id="Fig181"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 181</div>
</div>

<p>Before a mixture of gasolene vapour and air can
be ignited its temperature must be raised to about
2000 degrees Fahrenheit. I will show that heat
waves pass out from this spark gap by placing my
watch crystal filled with gasolene underneath the
knobs of the spark coil, (<a href="#Fig181">Fig. 181</a>). When now I
close the electric circuit at
the battery the mixture
of gasolene vapour and air
just above the watch crystal
is ignited. If I increase the distance between
the knobs you still hear the crackle of the
sound waves and see the light waves, but the mixture
of gasolene vapour and air does not ignite,
because there are not heat waves enough. The
automobilist expresses this fact by saying a "fat"
spark or a "warm" spark is needed. A battery
which has ceased to give a sufficiently hot spark
to explode the mixture of gasolene and air in the
cylinder of a gasolene engine may serve all other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
purposes quite as well as ever. It may ring bells
almost as long as it ever would.</p>

<p>I proved that the temperature for igniting a
mixture of gasolene vapour and air was nearly as
high as melting iron, by heating an iron rod to a
dull red heat and bringing it to the watch crystal
containing gasolene. It did not take fire. I showed
that it could not be ignited by a lighted cigar,
nor even by a glowing coal taken from the fire.</p>

<p>It was necessary to heat the iron rod to a very
bright red heat&mdash;nearly white heat, or nearly to its
melting point, before it would ignite the mixture.</p>

<p>These heat waves are ether waves, differing from
light only in having greater wave length. They
travel at the speed of light, they travel better
without air than with air. They come from the
sun and all other light-giving bodies. Indeed,
an ordinary incandescent electric lamp gives out
about twenty-four times as much energy in heat as
in light. Heat waves are being thrown off from all
bodies which are around us. The steam radiators
are placed in this room for the express purpose
of sending out heat waves through the ether in this
room. This is the chief method of distributing
heat, and it is hindered rather than helped by the
presence of the air. The walls, ceiling, floor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
furniture, people&mdash;everything here is sending out
heat waves.</p>

<p>The fourth kinds of waves, which go out from the
spark gap of our coil, are also waves in the ether.
They are still longer than heat or light. We have
ears for sound, eyes for light, and temperature sensation
for heat, but as yet we have not evolved a
delicate sense organ for detecting electric waves.
At least few of us claim to have such a sense. I
will, however, undertake to make you feel electricity.
I then adjusted the coil so that each boy might
take a mild electric shock from it by touching
the two knobs. That is by placing himself in the
spark gap. They agreed that although they could
not hear, see, taste, or smell electricity they were a
little more familiar with it now, having felt it.</p>

<p>Sound waves in air, as given out by the piano,
vary in length from, say, four inches to forty feet,
those having the shorter wave length being the
higher pitched tones.</p>

<p>Light waves in the ether, as given out by the
sun, vary in length from, say, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>60000</sub> to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>80000</sub> of an
inch, those having the shorter wave length being
the violet-coloured light, which may be seen in the
rainbow, and those having the longer wave length being
the red-coloured light of the rainbow or the sunset.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>Heat waves, which are also waves in the ether,
vary in length from above <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>80000</sub> to, say, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>5000</sub> of
an inch. Roentgen or X waves are ether waves,
shorter than light; while Hertzian, or wireless
telegraph waves are very long ether waves, varying
from a few feet to many rods in length. Those
used by Marconi in sending despatches across the
Atlantic Ocean are as long as 1000 feet, four or
five of them cover a mile, and 12,000 of them cover
the whole distance from Cape Cod to Poldhu.</p>

<p>Electric waves are easily broken up into the shorter
heat waves, or the still shorter light waves. On
the other hand Roentgen waves are readily transformed
into the longer light waves, and are thus
brought within our powers of vision.</p>

<p>Sound waves of various lengths (of high and low
pitch) all travel at the same speed (one mile in
five seconds), else how would the piccolo and the
bass horn of the distant band sound together. So
ether waves of various lengths (light, heat, electricity,
etc.) all travel at the same speed, <i>i. e.</i>, 186,000
miles per second.</p>

<p>For detecting the electric waves which may be
sent out from the spark gap of our automobile spark
coil I shall ask you to help me prepare a special
piece of apparatus. One boy may file this silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
ten-cent piece and another may file this nickel five-cent
piece, each gathering the filings upon a piece
of paper. A third boy may select a piece of glass
tubing about one eighth of an inch in the inside
diameter, and with a three-cornered file cut off a
short piece, about one and a half inches long, and
smooth the ends with a wet file. A fourth boy may
select a piece of stout copper wire nearly as large
as the bore of the glass tubing, and cut from it two
pieces, each about two inches long. Wind one end
of each of these with thread to make them fit snugly
in the glass tubing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_345.jpg" width="350" height="71" alt="" />
<a id="Fig182"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 182 Coherer</div>
</div>

<p>We thrust one of the wires into the tube, then
mixed equal parts of the silver and nickel filings and
put as much of the mixture into the tube as we could
hold upon the tip of a penknife blade, and then
thrust in the other copper wire. (See <a href="#Fig182">Fig. 182</a>.)
The ends of the wire
were about one eighth
of an inch apart and
the gap was loosely filled with the metal filings.
This was connected by short pieces of copper
wire, as shown in <a href="#Fig183">Fig. 183</a>, to a dry battery
cell, <i>B</i>, and a sensitive ammeter. When all connections
were made the needle of the ammeter remained
at zero, showing that no electric current was passing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
that is, the battery cell was unable to send any
electricity through the metal filings.</p>

<p>This is the apparatus which is to help us detect
electric waves when they pass about us. Electricity
has been called invisible
light, that is,
invisible to our eyes,
and this apparatus
has been called an
"electric eye" because
it will detect electric
waves in the ether,
just as our eyes may
detect light waves
passing through the
ether.</p>

<a id="Fig183"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 183</div>
</div>

<p>We placed the automobile spark coil upon the
table near to the tube containing the filings of
silver and nickel, and as soon as we made a spark
pass between the knobs the ammeter needle moved
half way across the scale, indicating that the spark
had somehow influenced the metal filings in the
tube so that now they permitted the battery cell
to send some electric current through them and
through the ammeter. I asked one of the boys to
tap the tube slightly with a lead pencil so as to jar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
the metal filings, and as soon as he did so the needle
of the ammeter went back to zero.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_347.jpg" width="350" height="309" alt="" />
<a id="Fig184"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 184</div>
</div>

<p>The spark coil sent electric waves out in every
direction, and those which hit the metal filings made
them cohere together. In that condition they
allowed the dry cell to send through them enough
current to move the needle of the ammeter. Tapping
the tube made the metal filings break apart
again, in which condition they do not allow the
current of the cell to pass in sufficient quantity
to move the needle. This tube is called a <i>coherer</i>,
because the filings in it cohere together. The apparatus
then serves to indicate when electric waves
are passing. As yet, however, it would not respond
when the spark coil was more than one foot away.
Our next step was to
attach extra pieces of
wire, each ten or twelve
feet long, at either end
of the coherer, as indicated
in <a href="#Fig184">Fig. 184</a>.
One of these wires
was stretched out upon
the floor while the other
one was connected with the wire of a picture hanging
upon the wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>We now found that the coherer would respond
when the spark coil was operated several feet away.
The extra wires which we had attached to the coherer
are called antennæ, because they suggest the long
"feelers" or antennæ of some insects.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<img src="images/i_349.jpg" width="250" height="221" alt="" />
<a id="Fig186"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 186</div>
</div>

<p>Our next step was to put antennæ upon the spark
coil also, as shown in <a href="#Fig185">Fig. 185</a>. One of these wires
was stretched out upon the floor, while the other
one was connected with the wire of a picture hanging
upon the wall on the opposite side of the room
from where the coherer was. We now found that the
coherer would respond when the spark coil was operated
in the farthest part of the room. With the wires
which were lying upon the floor extending toward
each other, but lacking several feet of touching,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
the coherer responded when the spark coil was
operated in various other rooms of the house,
although the doors between were shut. When the
floor wires were connected to the water pipes the
coherer would respond when the spark coil was
operated in a neighbouring house. We tried a
similar experiment, substituting an ordinary electric
bell for the spark coil. The coherer or electric eye
detected that ether waves were sent forth from an
electric bell every time a spark was produced in
the bell. For this purpose connections were made,
as shown in <a href="#Fig186">Fig. 186</a>. One dry battery cell was
used to ring the bell. The
floor wire <i>a</i>, or, as it is
usually called, the ground
wire, was connected to the
binding post 1, and the other
antenna was connected to
the screw 3, and then supported
aloft on a picture hung upon the wall. With
this transmitter we sent waves across the room
which were detected by the coherer.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_350.jpg" width="350" height="345" alt="" />
<a id="Fig187"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 187</div>
</div>

<p>We constructed a simple spark coil as follows:
We bought a pound of No. 24 single cotton covered
copper wire, such as is used in the electro-magnets
of bells. It was, when we bought it, wound upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
a wooden spool. We filled the hole in the centre
of this spool with wire nails. One dry cell was
connected with this (<a href="#Fig187">Fig. 187</a>). When the wires
at <i>d</i> were touched
together, and then
separated, a spark
was produced at that
point. A ground
wire was connected
at <i>b</i>, and an antenna
at <i>c</i>, as before.
Using this apparatus
now as a transmitter
of ether waves,
we found that the coherer detected them.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_351.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="" />
<a id="Fig188"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 188</div>
</div>

<p>We next gave our attention to making changes
in the receiving apparatus, not to change the coherer,
but to provide substitutes for the ammeter. A
sensitive <i>relay</i> was procured, which is essentially
like a bell or buzzer except that it does not clatter.
It will be readily understood, by referring to the accompanying
<a href="#Fig188">Fig. 188</a>, that <i>R</i> is a coil of insulated
wire around an iron core exactly like what we see in
the electric bell. (In practice there will be a pair
instead of one of them.) Such coils are called
electro-magnets, because when electricity flows in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
the wires they become magnets, and will attract
iron. <i>A</i> is an iron spring, <i>B</i> is a dry battery cell
and <i>C</i> is the coherer. Whenever an ether wave
passes the coherer permits
the battery cell to
send a current around
the magnet of the relay,
and it attracts the iron
spring <i>a</i>, so that it hits
against the metal post
<i>d</i> with a click. Whenever we used this to respond
to ether waves the click of the relay suggested the
telegraph sounder. How it served in wireless
telegraphy will appear in the following pages.</p>

<small>RINGING BELLS AND LIGHTING LAMPS BY ELECTRIC

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Harold</span> was to have a birthday party, to
which many of his school friends were
invited. For this occasion he prepared,
with my help, to perform for the girls and boys
some electrical experiments, and particularly to
give all who chose to try it an electric shock. For
this purpose he had them all join hands, and the
electric charge was sent through the whole line at
once. One thing he did shocked his mother more
than anything else. He instituted a mock court,
at which one of the boys was tried, convicted and
condemned to be executed by electricity. The
whole affair was enacted with no great solemnity,
but the electrical experiment was voted a great
success by the executed "criminal." The following
group of experiments, however, seemed to give the
most satisfaction: On a table was placed the
coherer connected to the relay, and in another room
was placed the spark coil for sending ether waves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
He had this operated by a confederate whom he
chose for the purpose. He then connected two
wires to the relay, one at <i>d</i> and the other at <i>e</i>
(<a href="#Fig189">Fig. 189</a>). These ran to a battery cell and a bell
in a far corner of the room. At a given signal
(a cough) the confederate made a spark at the spark
coil in the other room; this sent ether waves through
the partition between the rooms; the ether waves
caused the coherer to pass electricity from the dry
cell No. 1, to close the relay spring <i>R</i>. This acted
like a switch to close the second circuit through the
dry cell No. 2 and the bell, which rang out to the
surprise of all. It continued to ring until he tapped
the coherer tube and broke apart the filings. When
this had been tried to the satisfaction of all, the
company was invited to another room. Here they
found an electric train with tracks, train sheds,
stations, tunnels, bridges, switches, signals, etc.,
arranged upon a centre table. The electric train
was to be started by ether waves. A wire from the
railroad track was connected with <i>e</i> of the relay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
(See <a href="#Fig190">Fig. 190</a>). A wire from <i>d</i> of the relay was
connected to the third rail through a battery of
sufficient strength (Battery 2). The electric train
completed the circuit by connecting the tracks with
the third rail. All heard the crack of the spark
coil in the adjoining room, and saw the train start
immediately. Ether waves had caused battery
1 to close the relay <i>R</i>. This had closed the circuit
so that battery 2 might run the train, of course
by means of a motor in the train. He tapped the
coherer. The relay spring <i>R</i> flew open and the
train stopped. Presently another crack from the
adjoining room, and the train instantly started
again. When all the details of the electric train
had been examined the company was invited to
go to the dining room, which was dimly lighted by
candles. All were seated and busily conversing
when the crackling noise of the spark coil
was again heard, and a group of little electric
lights flashed forth upon a birthday cake. The
wires from the lamps and a battery to run them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
had been connected with the binding posts <i>d</i>
and <i>e</i> of the relay.</p>

</div>

<p>The chandelier over the dining-room table had
a pendant push button <i>A</i> (<a href="#Fig191">Fig. 191</a>), with which the
regular electric lights
could be turned on
and off. This I had
removed and extended
the wires
down upon the table.
It was only necessary
to connect these to
the binding posts <i>d</i>
and <i>e</i> of the relay,
and the next wave
from the spark coil lighted the chandelier.</p>

<p>The flexible wires underneath the dining-room
table with which the maid is usually summoned from
the kitchen were next extended up and connected
with <i>d</i> and <i>e</i> of the relay, and the maid was called
in by an ether wave. She brought with her a tray
in the centre of which stood an earthenware cup,
such as is used for baking custard. This had been
filled with a mixture of granulated sugar and powdered
potassium chlorate. Four dry battery cells
stood around this upon the tray connected in series<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
(<a href="#Fig192">Fig. 192</a>). A very small iron wire connecting two
of these cells dipped into the sugar mixture. Two
wires from the battery were connected to <i>d</i> and <i>e</i>
of the relay. At the
proper signal an ether
wave was sent out by
the spark coil. The
coherer closed the relay
and the relay acted as a
push button to close the
circuit of the four cells
upon the tray. The fine
wire dipping into the sugar and potassium
chlorate got red hot. This caused the mixture to
flash up and burn in most beautiful coloured flames.
(<a href="#Fig193">Fig. 193</a>).</p>

<p>On this occasion Harold's friends gave
him, with due formalities, the degree of E. E.,
which they said meant <i>electrical expert</i>,
and ever since that night he has been called
"the expert." I inquired of the young folks,
as their party was breaking up, if they understood
Harold's explanations of all these
things, and he replied that he at any rate understood
them better having attempted to explain them.</p>

<small>TELEGRAPHING BY ELECTRIC WAVES</small></h2>

<a id="Fig194"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 194</div>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> next time Harold and I experimented
we arranged something to save us the
trouble of tapping the coherer each time
we used it. We employed simply an electric bell,
<i>B</i> (<a href="#Fig194">Fig. 194</a>), from which we removed the gong.
By reference to the figure the arrangement will
be understood. Each
time ether waves cause
the metal filings to
cohere and the battery
<i>B<sup>1</sup></i> closes the relay <i>R</i>,
battery <i>B<sup>2</sup></i> causes the
hammer of <i>B<sup>3</sup></i> to tap
against the coherer. This causes the current to
cease to flow from <i>B<sup>1</sup></i> and the relay opens again
by its own spring.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_358.jpg" width="600" height="304" alt="" />
<a id="Fig195"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 195</div>
</div>

<p>Our next addition was a telegraph sounder as
shown in <a href="#Fig195">Fig. 195</a>. <i>B<sup>1</sup></i> is a single dry cell, <i>C</i> is
the coherer, <i>R</i> is the relay, <i>B<sup>2</sup></i> is now a battery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>of three cells. Part of its current goes to <i>B<sup>3</sup></i>,
the tapper for the coherer, and part of its current
goes to the electro-magnet of the telegraph sounder
<i>S</i>. Ordinarily a spring holds the iron strip <i>d</i> up
against the metal stop <i>a</i>, but when the current passes
through the electro-magnet it pulls down this iron
strip with a click against the metal stop <i>e</i>. But
while this is happening <i>C</i> is being tapped by <i>B</i>,
and is ready to respond to each wave. It was
only necessary now to have some code of signals
in order to communicate by telegrams. We learned
the system of dots and dashes, or short and long
periods marked off by the sounder, which all telegraphers
use and which is known as the Morse
alphabet, and very soon Harold and I were telegraphing
from one room to another messages of
several sentences at a time, the Morse alphabet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
being told off on the spark coil and being received
through the coherer and telegraph sounder. It was
not long before Harold and one of the neighbours'
boys were exchanging messages between their homes,
each having a spark coil and the necessary receiving
apparatus, and having extended their
antennæ to the top of the buildings into what are
called in the wireless language <i>aerials</i>.</p>

<div class="caption">Induction Coil of a Wireless</div>
</div>

<p>The fever for wireless telegraphy spread like wild-fire
among the boys. In a few months they had
formed a "wireless club." They had each read
anywhere from ten to thirty books and articles upon
the subject, and had secured the latest improved
apparatus. They made it a practice to spend hours
daily at their instruments picking up and keeping
on file messages which were sent to and from
steamers leaving the harbour for European ports.
On one occasion they showed me from these files
scores of messages&mdash;fond, personal, and supposedly
private farewells to friends and communications
between business partners which they
would never have made on land without first closing
the office door. The boys had acquired a mass
of technical knowledge upon the subject which far
exceeded my comprehension. But their teachers
in school complained that they would learn nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
else, and some of the boys had already received
warning that they might fail of promotion.</p>

<p>How to have compelling interests without riding
hobbies is the great problem for both boys and men.
I have known many boys who could, or at least
would, do nothing well in school or out, except some
specialty like manual training or science. In later
years they were so deficient in education that they
could hold no worthy position in anything. My
anxiety was to save my boy from such a fate. I
was determined that he should have a fair share
of all kinds of culture. To this end we read together
much of biography, history and classical literature,
ancient and modern, through the medium of the
English language.</p>

<p>As both prevention and cure of the wireless telegraph
mania I deemed it not necessary to suppress
enthusiasm, nor to introduce obviously useless tasks
for the sake of the training which might be in them.
My method was, on the contrary, to encourage
my boy to have several hobbies which he might ride
with enthusiasm, but to make it a rigorous rule to
exchange his "mount" occasionally.</p>

<small>HALLEY'S COMET AND ELECTRICAL WAVES</small></h2>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_363.jpg" width="600" height="291" alt="" />
<a id="Fig196"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 196</div>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It was</span> the year 1910 and Halley's comet was
approaching the sun. On May 18 its tail
might be expected to reach the earth. Astronomers
had requested all who might be possessed
of wireless telegraph apparatus to watch on that
day for any peculiar behaviour of their apparatus
so that evidence might be obtained whether or
not the comet sends forth such ether waves as we
call electricity. Harold desired me to explain the
whole matter to his group of friends, which I did
on a subsequent evening, as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>"Although Halley's comet has come within the
earth's orbit about three thousand times since its
first recorded appearance, I know of no man living
who can give a satisfactory account of having seen
it. Any one who has seen it before must be at least
seventy-five years old, for it requires seventy-five
years to make one complete circuit of its own orbit.
But no one who is now seventy-five could have observed
it intelligently, and even one who is now
eighty-five years old would have to tell what he
saw when he was ten years old and has remembered
for seventy-five years. Furthermore, any account
of how it looked on a former return is no guide
to how it may appear on this trip. You may
properly think of the comet as a group of solid
pieces no bigger than the stones you may throw,
scattered, two or three to the mile, through a space
12,500 miles broad. This extremely thin cloud
of particles does not reflect enough sunlight to be
visible, even in a telescope, in any part of its journey,
and hence we should be wholly unaware of its
existence if it did not sometimes have the strange
faculty of giving out light of its own <i>while in that
part of its own orbit nearest to the sun</i>. At such a
time there is a hazy light enveloping the mass of
small bodies, and streaming away sometimes many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
million miles from them. The mass of small bodies
is generally referred to as the nucleus, and the stream
of luminous gas which the nucleus gives forth is
called the tail, though it reminds me more of a
search-light.</p>

<p>"It does not trail along behind the comet but
always points away from the sun (<a href="#Fig197">Fig. 197</a>). The
normal thing for a comet to do is to
begin to develop a faint light and a
short streamer as it gets near to
the sun, to have its light grow
brighter and its streamer to grow
longer until it reaches the point
nearest the sun, and then to have
its light grow dimmer and the
streamer grow shorter as it recedes
from the sun.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_365.jpg" width="200" height="337" alt="" />
<a id="Fig197"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 197</div>
</div>

<p>"It has many times been suggested that this strange
search-light appearance may be an electrical phenomenon,
some form of ether waves which the
comet sends forth when under the immediate
influence of the sun. But not all comets are alike
in this matter, nor does the same comet always act
alike on succeeding trips, so that we may not predict
what Halley's comet will do on this visit. It would
be natural to suppose that Halley's comet, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
radium, might in time lose the power to radiate off
material, in which case it might at length become
wholly invisible to us, even though it continued to
travel in its wonted path. Our only way of knowing
of its existence then would be that on its returns
some of its small pieces might be attracted to the
earth and enter our atmosphere as meteors. This
sort of thing is continually happening, and may be
the last reminders of once brilliant comets.</p>

<p>"For almost a century it has been the common
belief that light is merely a wave motion in the
ether. Our eyes respond to ether waves of certain
length only. Waves a little longer than those which
affect our eyes are felt by us as heat waves. Waves
still longer than those of heat are the so-called
electric waves. These we use in wireless telegraphy.
There are still shorter waves than those of light.
These affect the sensitive plate in photography.
They help to form the green material in the leaves
of plants and the brilliant colours in flowers. They
assist in the fading of our clothes and the tanning
of our skin. These are called chemical waves.
Still shorter waves in the ether than those of which
we have just spoken are the X rays, and all the strange
things which they may do have not yet been determined.
Certain it is that they can make dreadful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
sores in our flesh. They can penetrate through
wood and paper, but not metals. They pass readily
through flesh, but not bones. All such ether waves
are treated in a book by Sylvanus P. Thompson,
entitled 'Light Visible and Invisible,' in which he
points out that electricity, heat, light, chemical
rays, etc., are all alike in being ether waves, and this
was suspected by James Clerk Maxwell and others
half a century ago, and has come now to be quite
generally believed.</p>

<p>"Halley's comet, already having been <i>seen</i> upon
this return, must be sending out those ether waves
which we call light; whether it is also sending forth
some of the other kinds of ether waves may yet
be determined."</p>

<p>My audience being chiefly composed of those
persons who were present at Harold's birthday party,
they pressed me to tell them more about wireless
telegraphy and similar matters, and so I agreed to
give them at some future date some account of the
history of these ideas. But my present purpose
was to start an interest in astronomy as an antidote
for the wireless epidemic, and so I invited all who
desired to do so to come again one week from that
evening, bringing with them such opera and field
glasses as they might be able to secure. I promised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
to show them how to make a telescope such as
Galileo had more than three hundred years ago.
I agreed to go out with them several evenings and
scan the sky with our telescopes, and to tell them of
some readable books and articles upon astronomical
matters.</p>

<h2><a name="XXV" id="XXV"></a>XXV<br /><br />
<small>HOW THE IDEA OF A UNIVERSAL ETHER DEVELOPED</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> evening for the meeting of the Science
Club had arrived. Its membership had
increased tenfold within a year. At its
monthly meetings, which were open to the public, an
audience of two hundred, old and young, was usually
present&mdash;a number about three times that of the
regular membership. General science was now
the study of this club. At its weekly meetings,
which only members attended, the studies of
specific topics by individuals, oftentimes illustrated
by experiments, were reported. These meetings
were held in one of my laboratories, while the open
monthly meeting was always held in my lecture
room, with some rather famous speakers to
instruct the audience. An enthusiastic friend of
science had given a fund with the stipulation that
we should engage the services of those who both
knew their subjects and had acquired the art of
presentation. The fund was $10,000 and it yielded
$500 a year. I think beyond question it was doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
more for science than any other fund of ten times
that amount which can be mentioned.</p>

<p>On the particular evening of which I am about to
speak, the lecturer told the members of the Science
Club frankly how, beginning at the age of thirteen,
he had spent forty years of <i>enjoyment in study</i>,
that he had always found great satisfaction in the
study of ancient civilizations and literatures. He
had been fortunate, he said, in having teachers
early in life who could make these subjects full of
meaning to him. His greatest satisfaction, however,
during the last twenty-five years had been found
in tracing the development of modern science, both
in the evolution of its theories and in its applications
to modern industries. He said he was sure that
young people of high-school age would find it profitable
to learn, for instance, how the modern theory
of combustion had developed slowly through the
centuries, even if to do so they must curtail somewhat
their study of how Greece and Rome developed
and declined. He said that science furnished a
tremendously rich field of study for young people,
which as yet had been untouched by our schools,
first, because educational conservatism had made it
impossible to determine the relative importance
of subjects of study, and, second, because education<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
in science had, for a brief period, found its worst
enemies within its own camp. He would like especially
to commend on this evening some historical
studies in science, and had chosen for his subject,
"How the Idea of a Universal Ether Developed."</p>

<p>Men seem to talk freely now about the transmission
of light, heat, and electricity by means of
the <i>ether</i>. How did this idea arise? Is it a product
of wild imagination? or did the idea develop out of
experiences which, if given to any person of fair
intelligence, would yield the same result?</p>

<p>A little over thirty years ago, at the Royal Institution
of Great Britain, James Clerk Maxwell
(1831&ndash;1879) delivered a lecture on "Action at a
Distance." It was no new subject, but rather one
of the oldest and most often discussed subjects
from the days of the ancient Greeks down to the
present. We talk of gravitation as an attraction
or pull between the various bodies of the universe,
but how can they pull one another without some
material bond between? This was Sir Isaac Newton's
great puzzle which he never solved, though he
expended upon it the greatest efforts of his great
intellect.</p>

<p>The sun appears to repel the tail of the comet, yet
how can there be a push without intervening material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
with which to push? When we speak of light
pouring or streaming in, do we think of it as a substance?
When we speak of warm bodies losing
heat, or when we cover them to keep the heat in, are
we thinking of heat as a substance? What are heat,
light, electricity, magnetism, and gravitation?</p>

<p>These are no new questions. They are certainly
older than history. Various ideas have prevailed
at different times. It is much easier to change our
ideas than to change our language. You occasionally
see and hear the words calorie and caloric used
in connection with heat. They stand for an idea,
abandoned for three generations, that heat is a
substance called caloric, which saturates warm
bodies and drains out of them when they cool off.
I hardly think these ideas either arise or fall without
good and sufficient reason. Each theory has been
the natural conclusion from our observations of
nature as far as we have gone with them. To be
sure, it is difficult for us to see how men acquired,
from any observations of nature, the idea of light
which seems to have prevailed previous to the time
of Aristotle, three and a half centuries B.C. This
idea was that objects were made visible by something
projected from the eye itself. Still, the questions
which I have indicated regarding heat, light,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
and electricity have impelled men for many centuries
to observe nature for hints as to the answers. The
doctrine of the universal ether as a medium for
transmitting wave motions, and of light, heat, and
electricity as being motions of different wave length,
is the natural conclusion of the present time. It
may give place to another theory when we have
further facts to reason upon. Imagine your never
having seen a harp or other musical instrument.
Would it require a long time, do you think, for you
to find out its use, at least to this extent, that it
will produce tones whenever the strings are made to
vibrate? That the short strings vibrate more rapidly
than the long ones, and at the same time produce
tones of a higher pitch? Imagine that having
become familiar with the harp you should successively
come upon scores of other musical instruments
of very differing types. You would soon become
adept at divining their uses. Now, a study of the
microscopic structure of the eye, for one thing, would
suggest that light may be in the nature of a vibration.
Scores of other lines of study in a similar
manner have at length brought all who pursue
them to the conclusion that light is a form of vibration.</p>

<p>Robert Hooke in England (1631&ndash;1703) and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
Christian Huygens in Holland (1629&ndash;1695), back
in the seventeenth century seem to have been
the first to give expression to this idea, which was
nothing more than an inkling in Hooke's mind, but
which was the necessary result of observations
on the part of Huygens. For nearly a century the
idea lay dormant, largely because Sir Isaac Newton
(1642&ndash;1727), the cleverest thinker of his time,
opposed it. It was perhaps unfortunate for the
success of the theory that Huygens, its founder,
adopted the word ether, for that was an old term,
and had been very badly overworked. The word
ether, or æther as it was often written, had been
invented in the days of ignorance, for such foolish
reasons as: (a) because "nature abhors a vacuum,"
or (b) "for planets to swim in," or (c) "to constitute
electric atmospheres and magnetic effluvia," or (d)
"to convey sensations from one part of our bodies
to another."</p>

<p>"When we remember," says Maxwell, "the mischievous
influence on science which hypotheses
about æthers used formerly to exercise, we can
appreciate the horror of æthers which sober-minded
men had during the eighteenth century."</p>

<p>Newton in England (1642&ndash;1727) and Laplace
in France (1749&ndash;1827) stoutly opposed the undulatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
theory of Huygens and championed a corpuscular
or emission theory, that light-giving and heat-giving
bodies emit a subtile fluid.</p>

<p>There is no other instance in the whole history
of modern physics in which truth was so long kept
down by authority. Fresnel (1788&ndash;1827) and
Arago (1786&ndash;1853) in France appear to be the
only persons during the eighteenth century who
caught a clear vision of the truth of the undulatory
theory.</p>

<p>But it remained for Mr. Thomas Young (1773&ndash;1829),
a colleague of Sir Humphrey Davy at the
Royal Institution, in his Bakerian lecture (1801)
on "Theory of Light and Colour" to bring together
such good evidence for the ether wave theory that
it has hardly been questioned since.</p>

<p>Young, like Davy, was a most remarkable man
in literature and in science. It was he who first
deciphered the Rosetta Stone, now in the British
Museum, and gave us a key to the Egyptian
hieroglyphics. Probably he was the only man who
was able to overthrow the influence of Newton's
authority even a century after Newton did his work.</p>

<p>Faraday's (1791&ndash;1867) chief work as director
of the laboratory of the Royal Institution, London,
was a study of ether phenomena, particularly electric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
and magnetic. About seventy-five years ago
he became impressed with the fact that although
wires may give direction to an electric current the
electric influence is not confined to the wires, but
may permeate more or less widely the region about
them.</p>

<p>Nearly fifty years ago Maxwell (1831&ndash;1878)
professor of physics at Cambridge University,
England, conceived the idea that light is electricity
of a very short wave length.</p>

<p>Nearly twenty-five years ago Heinrich Hertz
(1857&ndash;1894), in Germany, proved by experiments
the existence of electric waves, and measured their
length and velocity, determining their various
characteristics as compared with light.</p>

<p>About fifteen years ago Marconi developed a
wireless telegraph apparatus, which made it possible
to use electric waves for purposes of communication.</p>

<p>Thirteen years ago (1897) the first wireless telegraph
company was formed. Eleven years ago
(1899) the international yacht races in New York
Harbour were reported by wireless telegraph, and
bulletin boards in New York City announced to
waiting crowds the details of the race while it was
in progress. Nearly ten years ago (1901) wireless
despatches were first sent across the Atlantic Ocean.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
Wireless telegraphy was opened for public use in
1905, and very soon the company began to coöperate
with the regular telegraph companies. Nearly all
coastwise and trans-Atlantic steamers are now
equipped with wireless telegraph outfits, and a
law has passed both houses of Congress making
it obligatory on the part of steamers which carry
fifty or more passengers to have such equipment.
On several disabled steamers, notably the <i>Republic</i>,
loss of life has been averted by the wireless emergency
call for help, to which the captains of all steamers
feel obliged to respond. If you desire to communicate
with a friend who left for Europe several days
ago, you simply write him a telegram, addressing
it to his ship, and deliver it at your nearest telegraph
office. Each telegraph office has a record of the
location of every ship having a wireless telegraph
outfit. It despatches your message to the wireless
station along the coast which is nearest to your
friend's steamer, and from this station it is sent on
the ether to the ship. Or in some cases it may be
repeated from one ship to another along the Atlantic
highway until it reaches the desired one. Thus
also news of important events on either continent
is distributed daily on board ships which are crossing
the ocean. There are said to be more than 50,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
amateur wireless stations in the United States, and
already Congress is taking steps to regulate the use
of the wireless telegraph in order to prevent interference
with Government and other important
messages.</p>

<p>More than three dozen books and countless magazine
articles have already been written upon wireless
or ether wave telegraphy. Hundreds have
and thousands are contributing to our knowledge
of ether wave phenomena. If the names of all who
have said or done something to render stable the
foundations of this idea of a universal ether, whose
undulations account for the phenomena of heat,
light, and electricity, were to be mentioned, the list
would contain nearly all the important workers in
the field of physics for the last century.</p>

<small>ELECTRIC CURRENTS CANNOT BE CONFINED TO WIRES</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Harold</span> said that if electricity was so much
like light that it could go without wires
he thought light ought to be enough like
electricity to be conducted by wires on occasions.
I told him that I had no hope of being able to confine
light to a wire; indeed,
if the Science Club
would give me an opportunity
I would show
them that even when
electricity follows the
general direction of a
wire its influence is not
confined to the wire.
As a result of this bid
I received an invitation
to address an open meeting
of the Science Club.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_379.jpg" width="300" height="388" alt="" />
<a id="Fig198"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 198</div>
</div>

<p>In my first experiment on that occasion I took
a one-pound spool of No. 24 cotton-covered copper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
wire and crowded the hole in the spool full of wire
nails <i>A</i> (<a href="#Fig198">Fig. 198</a>). I disconnected the wires from
an electric drop lamp and connected them to <i>b</i>
and <i>c</i>, the ends of the wire from the spool. Our
electric lighting circuit was what is called the
<i>alternating current</i>. I also had a second spool, <i>B</i>,
precisely like the first. The wires from this were
connected to a miniature lamp, <i>L</i>, such as is used at
the switchboard of a telephone exchange. We then
screwed the drop-light plug into the chandelier and
turned on the electric current. I brought spool
<i>B</i> with the miniature lamp near to spool <i>A</i>, as shown
in <a href="#Fig199">Fig. 199</a>, and when it was within a distance of
about two inches the little lamp lighted up to full
brilliancy, thus showing that while the electric
current is passing in the wire of spool <i>A</i> its influence
is not confined to the wire, but exhibits itself in
the region outside of the wire. To illustrate still
further this fact we substituted an electric bell
in the place of the lamp <i>L</i>, and when the spool <i>B</i>
was brought near to <i>A</i> the bell rang. But the most
striking illustration was obtained when a telephone
receiver was put in the place of <i>L</i>. With this held
to the ear while the spool <i>B</i> was brought toward <i>A</i>
a humming sound could be heard when <i>B</i> was about
a foot distant from <i>A</i>. This sound grew rapidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
louder as <i>B</i> approached <i>A</i>, until, when the spool
<i>B</i> rested upon the spool <i>A</i>, a sound like the peal of
a pipe organ was heard all over the apartment.
The tone was very nearly that of the key on the
piano which is two octaves below middle <i>C</i>. I
unscrewed the cap on the large end of the telephone
receiver, took it off, and moved the thin iron diaphragm
to one side, when it began to dance about
at great speed. It was keeping time with the
dynamo, five miles away, which generated the electric
current. The dynamo changed the direction of
the electric current sixty times per second, and this
made sixty vibrations per second. The dynamo
sent out ether waves which affected the telephone
receiver, although the receiver was not connected
to the dynamo by wires.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_382.jpg" width="250" height="393" alt="" />
<a id="Fig199"></a><div class="caption">Fig. 199</div>
</div>

<p>To emphasize the fact that the dynamo had lighted
the lamp, rung the bell and made the telephone
receiver hum without being connected with them,
I repeated all these experiments in a different way.
Spool <i>A</i>, connected as before with the electric lighting
circuit, was concealed beneath the table. For
spool <i>B</i> I substituted spool <i>C</i> (<a href="#Fig199">Fig. 199</a>), on which
the wire was wound so as to appear like a candlestick.
On the top of this was placed the miniature
electric lamp screwed into a miniature socket and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
connected to the wires of the spool. This "Witches'
Candle," as we called it, was sitting unlighted upon
the table when I called attention to the fact that
if I moved it to a certain spot
upon the table it flashed into
full light. (Of course this spot
was directly over spool <i>A</i>.) I
moved it slowly away from that
spot and its light slowly grew
dim and disappeared.</p>

<p>On the table was also sitting a
cream pitcher in which I had
placed spool <i>B</i> with a buzzer attached
to it. Remarking that
this pitcher groaned for more cream whenever it
was empty, and thus of its own accord called the
waiter, I moved it to the spot on the table directly
over spool <i>A</i>, when the buzzer gave forth a sound
like a husky bumble-bee shut up in a resounding
bottle. At this signal my assistant came in and
took up the pitcher and placed my silk hat
upon the table, when it instantly boomed forth
a base note two octaves below middle <i>C</i> of
the piano. Out of the hat I took a coil and
the telephone receiver and the mystery was
solved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>In 1819 Hans Christian Oersted in Denmark
(1777&ndash;1851) first noted that the region about a wire
carrying an electric current has an influence upon a
magnet. I will show this fact by a simple experiment.
I magnetize a stout sewing needle by drawing it
from end to end across the pole of a steel magnet,
and by means of a triangular piece of paper and a
fine thread I suspend it a few inches above the table
(<a href="#Fig200">Fig. 200</a>). I then lay upon the table a piece of
wire parallel with the needle and fasten one end of
it to one binding post of a dry cell. Whenever I
touch the other end of the wire to the other binding
post of the cell, thus sending an electric current<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
through the wire, the magnetized needle is deflected
at right angles.</p>

<p>This experiment, performed by Oersted, seems to
have started Faraday upon that wonderful series
of researches which has resulted in giving us the
dynamo.</p>

<small>WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY IN EARNEST</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">We had</span> decided to let Harold make a trip
to Europe alone. The first message from
him after his departure was a brief note
to his mother saying that they had had a turbulent
voyage, but all had landed safely upon the other side,
none the worse for their experiences.</p>

<p>The next day a number of letters came to me from
total strangers. One of these ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>Prompted by my own impulses, and urged to do so by the
passengers under my charge, I improve this first opportunity
to express to you our high appreciation for your noble but very
modest son, to whom more than to any one else we owe the
lives of all on board our fated ship.</p>

<p>I am sending this direct to you both, because I understand a
father's heart and because the young man escaped as soon as we
came to land, without any of us learning his address. I
beg you will communicate to him the desire of the president
of our company to meet him and personally to thank
him for his gallant conduct. I am also instructed to
say that whenever Harold desires to cross the ocean the
best which any ship I may command can afford will be his
without charge.</p>
</div>

<div class="blocksig">
Very respectfully yours,<br />
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Captain.<br />
S. S.<br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>Another letter was the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>Permit me to congratulate you on having such a heroic
and self-possessed son. We, his fellow passengers, are, if possible,
as proud of him as you must be.</p>

<p>I fear that his account of the affair will not do himself full
justice, and so, with your permission, I will give you the full
details as I have gathered them from the passengers, from the
crew, and from my own observation.</p>

<p>During the last night of our voyage a thick fog closed about
us. The constant blowing of the fog whistle made the night
dismal. Few persons slept at all. About two o'clock in the
morning the ship struck a reef, and instantly it seemed as
though every person on that ship reached the decks at the
same time. The water poured in and put out the fires. The
ship heeled badly, and it seemed that any minute she might
slip off the reef on which she was resting into deep water and
go down. To add to our horror fire broke out. It seems to
have started in the wireless operator's room.</p>

<p>Very much damage was done to the wireless outfit itself, and
the operator was badly burned, so much so that he was taken
to the ship's hospital suffering with many painful and dangerous
wounds.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the flames spread rapidly and we were unable to
summon help. The crew and many of the passengers fought
the flames, but with little success.</p>

<p>In the midst of our despair word passed around the ship that
an unknown boy from among the passengers was sending
the C. Q. D. message to all the world by wireless. It was
afterward learned that your Harold was the youth. He had
repaired the damaged apparatus sufficiently to establish connection
with a storage battery which he found, and, under the
captain's direction, was sending forth that hurry call for help
known to all the wireless fraternity and heeded by all sea-faring
men. I learned that your boy was not a regular operator,
but that somehow he had learned to send this message and
also to send out the captain's calculations of our position at sea.
He was also able to detect that his call had been heard and that
help was coming, although he could not understand much that
came to his instrument in reply to his calls. I learned, also,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
that he was one of the first to reach the operator's room and to
give assistance. He was himself badly burned, so much so
that one hand was being dressed by a nurse while he was continually
using the other to operate his instrument.</p>

<p>I can testify, my dear sir, that he appeared to be the calmest
and most self-possessed person on board that ship, as I saw
him in the glare of the dreadful flames which lit up the blackest
night.</p>

<p>I am an artist and would like to attempt to paint that scene,
which has left its lasting impression upon my soul. I beg that
you will allow me to exhibit it for a time in several of our
galleries and finally present it to your family.</p>

<p>Help came none too soon. We were all transferred to other
boats, but the sea was rising, and scarcely had we reached a
safe distance when the burning ship slipped into the sea and
disappeared.</p>

<p>I do not know by which boat your son reached the land.
In the great confusion I lost sight of him at last. He has
doubtless communicated with you by this time, and I shall
esteem it a great favour if you will put me in communication
with him again.</p>

<p>In order that I may do justice to him in the painting I would
like to arrange with him a few sittings while he is in Europe.</p>

<p>Could you kindly send me a photograph of him which will
assist me somewhat?</p>
</div>

<div class="blocksig">
Most sincerely and gratefully yours,<br />
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.<br />
</div>

<p>The letter contained several references to mutual
acquaintances.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Harold's letters have been frequent and full of
the pleasure he is having in European travel, but
the only thing he has said about the voyage is that
"it was not worth so much fuss."</p>
